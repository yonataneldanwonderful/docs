## What Tags Are

Tags are yes/no markers applied to a conversation or turn. They serve multiple purposes:

- **Analytics** — Track patterns and outcomes across interactions
- **Routing** — Direct conversations based on characteristics
- **Behavior tracking** — Monitor how agents handle different scenarios
- **Product logic** — Trigger downstream actions based on conversation characteristics

## Tag Sources

### LLM Tags

LLM tags are generated through prompt-based inference. The agent analyzes conversation context and applies tags based on its understanding. We keep the tag prompt as-is, allowing the LLM to make nuanced decisions about when tags should be applied.

### Deterministic Tags

Deterministic tags are applied based on rules that evaluate events. These rules can trigger tags when:

- A specific skill is loaded
- A particular tool is called
- An error code is encountered
- An escalation occurs
- Any other system event matches a rule condition

## Why Deterministic Tags

Deterministic tags provide several advantages:

- **100% consistent** — Same events always produce the same tags
- **Real-time** — Tags are applied immediately as events occur
- **Cheaper** — No LLM calls required for deterministic tagging
- **Debuggable** — Clear rules make it easy to understand why tags were applied
- **Reliable for metrics** — Consistent tagging ensures accurate analytics

## Examples

- Tool `send_sms` succeeds → tag `sms_sent`
- Skill `cancel_card` loaded → tag `credit_card`
- Agent escalates → tag `escalation`
- Error code `PAYMENT_FAILED` → tag `payment_issue`
- Tool `create_ticket` called → tag `support_ticket_created`

Tags provide a flexible annotation system that enables both human-readable analytics and machine-driven routing and logic.
