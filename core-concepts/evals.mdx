## What Evals Are

Evals are structured test scenarios that measure agent behavior. They provide a systematic way to validate that agents perform correctly across different situations and use cases.

## Eval Types

### Single Scenario

Single scenario evals test one specific interaction pattern. They validate that an agent handles a particular case correctly, such as booking an appointment or handling a refund request.

### Batch

Batch evals run multiple scenarios with iterations. They test agent behavior across a range of cases and can include multiple runs to check for consistency. Batch evals are useful for regression testing and validating improvements.

### Voice Evals

Voice evals specifically test voice channel interactions. They account for the unique characteristics of voice, including timing, latency, barge-in behavior, and audio quality considerations.

### Human Feedback

Human feedback evals incorporate human judgment to improve agent behavior. They allow reviewers to assess agent responses and provide guidance for refinement.

## Eval Components

Evals include several key components:

- **Scenario text** — The input or situation being tested
- **Expected answers** — What the agent should say or do
- **Tool/behavior checks** — Validation that correct tools were called
- **Metrics** — Quantitative measures of performance
- **Output comparison** — How actual behavior compares to expected behavior

Evals are tied to agent versions, enabling you to test changes before publishing and compare performance across versions.
