## Supported Channels

Wonderful supports multiple communication channels:

- **Voice** — SIP, phone numbers, TTS/ASR
- **Chat** — Web chat, widgets
- **Email** — Email-based interactions
- **WhatsApp** — WhatsApp messaging
- **Embed** — Embedded chat interfaces

## What Channels Do

Channels are responsible for:

- **Delivering the conversation** — Presenting messages to users in the appropriate format
- **Providing metadata** — Channel-specific context like user location, device type, or session information
- **Configuring entry points** — Setting up phone numbers, inboxes, or embed widgets
- **Applying channel-specific prompts** — Customizing agent behavior for each channel's unique characteristics

## Behavior

All channels share the same agent logic. The core intelligence, skills, and tools work identically across channels. Differences are primarily in:

- **Formatting** — How messages are presented (text, voice, email format)
- **Input handling** — How user input is captured and interpreted
- **Timing** — Voice adds considerations for latency, barge-in, and turn-taking
- **Context** — Channel-specific metadata that informs agent behavior

This unified approach means you build agent logic once and deploy it everywhere. The same skills and tools work across voice, chat, email, and WhatsApp without modification.
