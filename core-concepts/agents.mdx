## What an Agent Is

An agent is a complete AI entity that can converse, call tools, load skills, and run across channels. Each agent is customized for a specific purpose and defines how the AI thinks and behaves.

## Agent Components

### System Prompt

The system prompt is a hidden scaffold that defines the core operating rules. It establishes the fundamental behavior and constraints that govern all agent interactions.

### System Tools

System tools are internal tools used for engine-level behavior. Examples include `skip_turn` and `escalate`. These tools enable the agent to manage conversation flow and handle edge cases.

### Agent Prompt

The agent prompt defines the persona, goals, and constraints specific to this agent. It shapes how the agent presents itself and what it prioritizes in conversations.

### Agent Tools

Agent tools are always-available tools that the agent can call regardless of which skills are loaded. These typically include CRM APIs, payment APIs, and RPA actions that are core to the agent's functionality.

### Skills

Skills are domain-specific modules loaded only when needed. They provide focused capabilities for specific scenarios. Skills can be dynamically loaded based on conversation context or deterministic rules.

### Skill Tools

Skill tools become available when a specific skill is active. These tools are scoped to the skill's domain and only accessible when that skill is loaded.

### Agent Settings

Agent settings configure behavior across channels and scenarios:

- **Initial message per channel** — Custom greetings for voice, chat, email
- **Timeout & retry behavior** — How the agent handles delays and failures
- **Voice config** — Voice selection, speed, and style for voice interactions
- **PII reduction** — Privacy controls for sensitive data
- **Channel setup** — Phone numbers, inboxes, embed widgets

## Agent Versioning

Agents support a versioning workflow:

**Draft → Versioned → Published**

- **Draft**: Work-in-progress changes that don't affect production
- **Versioned**: Snapshot of agent configuration at a point in time
- **Published**: Active version running in production

Evals are tied to versions, enabling you to:
- Test specific versions before publishing
- Compare performance across versions
- Rollback to previous versions if needed
- Track improvements over time

Versioning ensures you can iterate safely and maintain production stability.
