# Authentication

Authentication in Wonderful covers three main surfaces: end users interacting with agents, operators using the dashboard, and external systems calling APIs or tools. This page focuses on the concepts relevant when building agents and connecting integrations.

## Overview

At a high level:

- **Dashboard and API auth** ensure that only authorized users and services can manage agents, skills, tools, and tenant settings.  
- **Channel auth** covers how end users are identified or authenticated in voice, chat, email, or messaging channels.  
- **Integration auth** (for example OAuth) covers how tools securely call third-party APIs on behalf of a tenant or user.

As a builder, you mainly interact with integration auth and any customer-facing auth flows your agents rely on.

## How It Works

1. **Operator and API authentication**  
   - The Wonderful dashboard and APIs require authenticated users with roles and permissions.  
   - Authentication is typically backed by identity providers and token-based sessions (details depend on deployment).
2. **Integration authentication (OAuth and secrets)**  
   - Tools that call third-party APIs use:
     - OAuth integrations (`OAuthIntegration` and `oauth.Provider` abstractions), or  
     - Secrets stored in secret manager.  
   - The OAuth layer manages token exchange, refresh, revocation, and user info retrieval.
3. **End-user and channel-level identification**  
   - In many cases, end users are known by channel identifiers (for example phone number, email, messaging ID) rather than explicit logins.  
   - Agents can still implement authentication flows via tools (for example OTP, account lookup) if required by the use case.
4. **Tenant scoping**  
   - All authentication flows (operators, APIs, integrations) are scoped to tenants so data and capabilities are isolated per tenant.

## Components

- **Identity providers and OAuth**  
  - Interfaces for OAuth providers (`Provider`), token and user info types (`TokenInfo`, `UserInfo`), and integrations with third-party services.

- **Tokens and sessions**  
  - Access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens used to authorize API calls and dashboard sessions.

- **Permissions and scopes**  
  - Role- and permission-based access controls in the dashboard and APIs that determine what actions a user or integration can perform.

- **Tool-level auth**  
  - Tools configured to use OAuth tokens or secrets when calling external systems.

## Usage

1. **Configure identity and SSO (operators)**  
   - Set up identity providers and SSO for dashboard users according to your organization’s standards.
2. **Register integrations for tools**  
   - For each external system a tool needs to call, configure OAuth or secrets in the appropriate settings.  
   - Ensure tokens and scopes are limited to required capabilities.
3. **Design customer-facing auth flows**  
   - For agents that must authenticate end users (for example banking or account management), use tools to implement identity verification and account linking flows.
4. **Scope everything to tenants**  
   - Keep integrations and credentials tenant-scoped so that multiple tenants remain isolated.

## FAQ's

- **How do tools authenticate to external APIs?**  
  Tools either use OAuth tokens (managed via `OAuthIntegration` and provider-specific clients) or secrets from secret manager, depending on integration type.

- **How is access to agent configuration controlled?**  
  Dashboard APIs are protected by user authentication and role-based permissions; only authorized roles can edit agents, skills, tools, and tenant settings.

- **Can agents enforce their own authentication with end users?**  
  Yes. You can build explicit authentication steps into agent flows using tools (for example OTP, account lookup) while still relying on underlying channel identifiers.
