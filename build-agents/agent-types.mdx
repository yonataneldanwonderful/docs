# Agent types

Agent types are a design tool for deciding what kind of agent you are building (for example support, sales, collections, or back-office) and which defaults it should inherit. They are a way to align business objectives with configuration, not a separate model in the runtime.

## Overview

When you create an agent in Wonderful, you are implicitly making choices about:

- **Primary use case**: support, sales, operations, collections, internal assistant, etc.
- **Channel mix**: voice‑first, chat‑first, email follow‑ups, WhatsApp outreach.
- **Governance level**: how strict PII masking, logging, and automated issues should be.
- **Skill/tool composition**: what skills and tools the agent should start with.

Agent types make these choices explicit so teams can:

- Use a shared language (“this is a support agent” vs “this is an outbound collections agent”).  
- Reuse opinionated defaults instead of configuring everything from scratch.  
- Avoid mixing incompatible use cases into a single agent.

NOTE: Today, “agent type” is primarily a **design and UI concept** anchored in how you configure agents (skills, tools, channels, governance). There is no dedicated `AgentType` field in the `Agent` model; instead, type is reflected through configuration choices.

<Info>
  Treat **agent types** as an internal design pattern and shared language, not as a strict runtime type. Use them to standardize how teams configure agents for recurring use cases.

## How It Works

Conceptually, each agent type is a bundle of defaults across:

1. **Channels** – which channels are considered primary vs optional.  
2. **Skills & tools** – which skills and toolkits are commonly attached.  
3. **Timeouts & routing** – how long conversations can run, when to escalate, and where to route.  
4. **Governance** – whether to enable automated issues, stricter PII, and additional tagging by default.  

In practice you implement an agent type by:

- Choosing an appropriate **agent prompt** (instructions) that reflects the role.  
- Attaching a relevant **skill set** and toolkits.  
- Configuring **channels, timeouts, PII, and governance** to match the risk profile.  
- Using **tags and evals** specific to that type’s KPIs (for example first call resolution for support, conversion for sales).

Over time, your organization can standardize these patterns as templates and internal guidance.

## Components

Below are example agent types and the defaults they typically imply.

- **Inbound support agent**  
  - **Use case**: handle customer questions, issues, and requests.  
  - **Primary channels**: voice + chat; optional email/WhatsApp for follow‑ups.  
  - **Skills**: authentication/identification, FAQ/help, ticket creation, account updates, escalations.  
  - **Governance**: strong PII masking, automated issues enabled, detailed tagging for issues and outcomes.

- **Sales / lead qualification agent**  
  - **Use case**: qualify leads, schedule meetings, handle objections.  
  - **Primary channels**: voice (outbound), chat, WhatsApp.  
  - **Skills**: qualification, calendar/meeting scheduling, CRM updates, follow‑up sequencing.  
  - **Governance**: PII controls for contact data, tags for funnel stage and intent, evals focused on compliance and conversion quality.

- **Collections / payments agent**  
  - **Use case**: handle payments, dunning, and collections.  
  - **Primary channels**: voice + outbound messaging.  
  - **Skills**: identity verification, payment processing, plan negotiation, escalations.  
  - **Governance**: strict PII and logging rules, tool configuration for payment providers, risk‑focused evals and alerts.

- **Back-office / internal assistant**  
  - **Use case**: support internal teams with data lookup, triage, and automations.  
  - **Primary channels**: chat, possibly internal voice lines.  
  - **Skills**: internal system lookup, triage, documentation search (RAG), workflow triggers.  
  - **Governance**: internal access controls, tags for request types and SLA, evals for accuracy and latency.

These patterns are not enforced by the runtime, but they should guide how you configure agents and which building blocks you select.

## Usage

When starting a new build:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clarify the primary objective">
  Decide whether the agent is primarily supporting customers, driving sales, collecting payments, or helping internal teams.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a working agent type">
  Pick the closest type (support, sales, collections, back-office) as a design lens, even if you don’t yet have a formal template.
</Step>

<Step title="Align skills and tools with the type">
  For example, support agents should favor ticketing and helpdesk tools; sales agents should favor CRM and calendar tools.
</Step>

<Step title="Align channels and governance">
  Support agents might need stricter logging and tagging; internal assistants might prioritize speed and breadth of access.
</Step>

<Step title="Document the chosen type">
  Capture the agent’s type and purpose in its description so others can understand and evolve it consistently.
</Step>
</Steps>

As you mature, you can standardize these types into reusable internal blueprints or onboarding playbooks.

## FAQ's

- **Is agent type stored in the codebase?**  
  Not today as a dedicated `AgentType` field; types are expressed through configuration choices (skills, tools, prompts, governance, channels).

- **Can I mix multiple types in a single agent?**  
  You technically can, but it often leads to complex, harder‑to‑control behavior. Prefer separate agents when objectives, governance, or KPIs are significantly different.

- **How many agent types should an organization have?**  
  Start with a small, opinionated set (for example 3–5) that reflect real teams/use cases, then refine as you see patterns emerge.
