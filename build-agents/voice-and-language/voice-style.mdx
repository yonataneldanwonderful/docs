# Voice style

Voice style controls how an agent sounds beyond just voice identity: tone, energy, formality, and prosody. Different providers expose style in different ways, but Wonderful models styles at both the voice-catalog and provider configuration level.

## Overview

Styles help you:

- Differentiate agents (for example friendly support vs. formal collections).  
- Adapt tone to channel or context.  
- Experiment with different delivery without changing the underlying voice.

In the data model, styles appear as:

- `VoiceStyle` entries in the `Voice` catalog.  
- Provider-specific style fields (for example style parameters in ElevenLabs or DeepDub directive config).

## How It Works

1. **Voice catalog styles**  
   - Each `Voice` has a `Styles` list of `VoiceStyle` entries (`Id`, `Name`) representing named style presets available for that voice.
2. **Provider-specific style controls**  
   - DeepDub: `VoiceStyle` in `DeepDubVoiceConfiguration` and potential directive configurations.  
   - ElevenLabs: style-related parameters (for example `Style` fields) influence how the voice is rendered.  
   - Other providers may expose style as named presets or numeric sliders.
3. **Agent configuration**  
   - When configuring an agent, you pick a provider, a voice, and optionally a style/preset or style parameters.  
   - These settings are applied whenever speech is synthesized for that agent.
4. **Runtime behavior**  
   - During calls, the selected style affects the overall delivery but usually stays constant for the interaction unless changed explicitly.

## Components

- **VoiceStyle model**  
  - `Id`, `Name`: identify a specific style preset associated with a voice.

- **Provider style configuration**  
  - Provider-specific fields in voice configurations that adjust style, tone, or prosody.

- **AgentVoiceConfiguration**  
  - The place where you select style-relevant settings per agent.

## Usage

1. **Choose base voices first**  
   - Select voices that match your brand, language, and persona; then experiment with styles on top of those choices.
2. **Pick styles for key scenarios**  
   - For support, choose friendly and calm styles.  
   - For collections or compliance calls, choose clearer, more formal styles.  
   - For sales, consider more energetic and engaging styles.
3. **Test styles with real scripts**  
   - Use representative phrases (greetings, explanations, bad-news delivery) to evaluate how styles feel in practice.
4. **Roll out gradually**  
   - Try styles with a subset of traffic or in non-critical flows before applying them broadly.

## FAQ's

- **Can I change style without changing the voice?**  
  Yes. Styles are layered on top of a base voice, so you can adjust tone while keeping the same voice identity where supported by the provider.

- **Can style change mid-call?**  
  This depends on provider capabilities and configuration; most setups assume a consistent style per interaction for simplicity.

- **How do I ensure style consistency across agents?**  
  Standardize on a small set of styles per brand or region and reuse them across agents where possible.
