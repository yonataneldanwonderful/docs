# Voices

Voices define how your agents sound in voice interactions: accent, gender, style, and overall character. Wonderful supports multiple voice providers and a tenant-level voice catalog so you can choose consistent, on-brand voices for each use case.

## Overview

Voices are represented by:

- A **voice catalog** (`Voice` model) with `Id`, `Name`, `Locale`, `Gender`, and available `Styles`.  
- **Agent voice configuration** that chooses which provider and voice to use for each agent.  
- Provider-specific configuration for DeepDub, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, PlayAI, and Azure OpenAI.

Use this page when you want to pick appropriate voices for agents and understand how they relate to providers and styles.

## How It Works

1. **Voice catalog**  
   - `Voice` records capture voice identity: `Id`, `Name`, `Locale`, `Gender`, and available `VoiceStyles`.  
   - Styles are name/id pairs that represent different speaking modes or presets for a given voice.
2. **Agent voice configuration**  
   - `AgentVoiceConfiguration` references provider-specific voice settings (DeepDub, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, PlayAI, Azure OpenAI) and global flags like `AutomaticSpeed`, `SlowReading`, and `EmotionalAgent`.  
   - Each provider configuration includes its own voice identifiers and parameters (for example `VoiceId`, `ModelId`, speed, style).
3. **Provider selection**  
   - Runtime selects the appropriate provider configuration based on agent and tenant settings, then uses the configured voice for TTS.  
   - Some tenants may enable extended voice configuration features via tenant feature flags.
4. **Runtime usage**  
   - During calls, the chosen voice and style are used for all agent speech in that interaction unless explicitly changed.

## Components

- **Voice model (`Voice`)**  
  - `Id`, `Name`: internal and human-readable identifiers.  
  - `Locale`: language/region.  
  - `Gender`: voice gender.  
  - `Styles`: list of available `VoiceStyle` options.

- **AgentVoiceConfiguration**  
  - Provider-specific configurations: DeepDub, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, PlayAI, Azure OpenAI.  
  - Flags for automatic speed, slow reading, and emotional agent behavior.

- **Tenant voice features**  
  - Tenant feature flags that enable extended voice configuration for certain tenants.

## Usage

1. **Define your voice strategy**  
   - Decide how many distinct voices you need (for example one per brand line, region, or use case).  
   - Choose whether support, sales, and back-office agents should sound the same or different.
2. **Select voices from the catalog**  
   - For each agent, choose a voice whose locale and tone match the target users.  
   - Use styles to adjust mood and delivery without changing the base voice.
3. **Configure provider-specific settings**  
   - Set model and voice IDs, speed, style, and other provider parameters under `AgentVoiceConfiguration`.  
   - Use previews to validate how the voice sounds with real phrases.
4. **Test across scenarios**  
   - Listen to interactions in different contexts (greetings, problem explanation, escalations) to ensure the voice still feels appropriate.

## FAQ's

- **Can I use different voices for different agents?**  
  Yes. Each agent has its own voice configuration, so you can pick voices per agent or per group of agents.

- **Can an agent change voice during a call?**  
  Voice changes at runtime depend on provider capabilities and configuration; most setups use a single voice per agent per interaction.

- **How do I ensure consistency across regions and languages?**  
  Use locale-aware voice choices and ensure that voices and styles are aligned with your brand guidelines for each market.
