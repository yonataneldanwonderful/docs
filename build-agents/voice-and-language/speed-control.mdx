# Speed control

Speed control lets you adjust how fast agents speak in voice interactions, affecting comprehensibility, perceived politeness, and call duration. Wonderful exposes both global agent-level toggles and provider-specific speed settings.

## Overview

Speed is configured through:

- Agent-level flags such as `AutomaticSpeed` and `SlowReading`.  
- Provider-specific voice speed fields in voice configurations (for example `voice_speed` or `Speed`).  
- First-message speed overrides in some providers.

Use speed control to balance natural pacing, user comfort, and efficiency across languages and use cases.

## How It Works

1. **Agent voice configuration**  
   - `AgentVoiceConfiguration` includes:
     - `AutomaticSpeed`: whether to automatically adjust speed based on context.  
     - `SlowReading`: whether to prefer slower delivery (for example for complex or compliance-critical content).
2. **Provider-specific speed**  
   - DeepDub: `VoiceSpeed` and `FirstMessageSpeed` on `DeepDubVoiceConfiguration` control baseline and first-message speed.  
   - ElevenLabs: `Speed` on `ElevenLabsVoiceConfiguration`.  
   - Cartesia, PlayAI, Azure OpenAI: provider-specific speed fields (`VoiceSpeed` or similar).
3. **First-message overrides**  
   - Some providers (for example DeepDub) support `FirstMessageSpeed` so you can speak faster or slower on the greeting and then switch to a different rate for the rest of the interaction.
4. **Runtime behavior**  
   - When generating speech, the runtime reads the agent’s voice configuration and provider-specific settings to set the output speed for each chunk or utterance.

## Components

- **AgentVoiceConfiguration**  
  - `AutomaticSpeed`, `SlowReading`: high-level agent preferences for speed.  
  - Provider-specific sections for DeepDub, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, PlayAI, Azure OpenAI.

- **Provider voice configurations**  
  - DeepDub: `VoiceSpeed`, `FirstMessageSpeed`, and directive configurations.  
  - ElevenLabs: `Speed` parameter.  
  - Others: provider-specific speed knobs.

- **Chunk-aware behavior**  
  - Some providers adjust speed differently for the first chunk vs subsequent chunks.

## Usage

1. **Set sensible defaults per agent**  
   - For support agents, choose moderate speeds and consider `SlowReading` for complex instructions.  
   - For transactional or IVR-like flows, you may increase speed slightly to reduce call time while staying understandable.
2. **Fine-tune provider settings**  
   - Adjust provider-specific `voice_speed` or `Speed` values and test them with real voice previews.  
   - Use `FirstMessageSpeed` where available to greet faster or slower than the rest of the call.
3. **Test across languages and segments**  
   - Listen to calls in different languages and for different user segments (for example seniors vs general population) to validate pacing.
4. **Monitor impact**  
   - Observe call duration, user sentiment, and escalation rates when adjusting speed settings.

## FAQ's

- **Should I always enable automatic speed?**  
  Not necessarily. Automatic speed can help in some cases, but you should test with your content and user base; explicit speed settings often provide more control.

- **Can I change speed mid-call?**  
  Speed is configured at the agent and provider level; dynamic mid-call adjustment may require changing configuration between utterances or using provider-specific APIs.

- **Does speed affect transcription accuracy?**  
  Indirectly. Very fast speech can be harder for ASR; keep speeds within ranges recommended by providers for your languages.
