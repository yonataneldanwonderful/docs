# Language

Language configuration controls how agents understand and respond across markets: locale, transcription language, TTS voice language, and any translation behavior. This page focuses on how to configure language behavior when building agents.

## Overview

Wonderful is designed to operate in many languages, with:

- Agent locale and gender driving default prompts and greetings.  
- Transcriber and voice configurations selecting the right ASR/TTS providers and voices.  
- Optional transcription translation enabling agents to operate in one language while customers speak another.

Language choices affect both user experience and model behavior, so they should be configured deliberately for each agent and tenant.

## How It Works

1. **Agent locale and greetings**  
   - Each agent has a `Locale` and `Gender` which are used to:
     - Choose localized default initial messages and responses.  
     - Influence voice configuration for certain providers.
2. **Voice language**  
   - Voice-related configuration (for example provider-specific voice settings) controls which language and voice the agent uses in voice channels.
3. **Transcription language**  
   - Transcriber configuration determines in which language speech recognition runs for voice interactions.
4. **Translation (optional)**  
   - Agents can enable transcription translation (`EnableTranscriptionTranslation`, `TranslationLanguage`) so that:
     - Incoming speech is transcribed and translated into a working language for the model.  
     - Responses can be rendered back in the user’s language via TTS settings.
5. **Tenant-level features and constraints**  
   - Tenant settings can enable or disable extended voice configuration and other features that influence language support.

Together, these settings define how an agent behaves linguistically across voice, chat, and email.

## Components

- **Agent locale**  
  - Determines default language for prompts, messages, and certain i18n behaviors.

- **Voice configuration**  
  - Chooses voice provider, voice name, speed, and features (for example denoiser model, emotional mode) which may be language-specific.

- **Transcriber configuration**  
  - Selects ASR provider and language used to transcribe audio for voice calls.

- **Translation settings**  
  - `EnableTranscriptionTranslation` and `TranslationLanguage` control whether input is translated before being processed.

- **Tenant language settings and lists**  
  - Tenant-level configuration and language support lists help determine which languages are available where.

## Usage

1. **Set the agent’s primary locale**  
   - Choose the locale that reflects the agent’s main market and language; this informs greetings and default behavior.
2. **Configure voice language and provider**  
   - In Voice & language settings, pick a voice that supports your target language and region.  
   - Verify pronounciation and style are appropriate via voice previews.
3. **Configure transcription language**  
   - Choose a transcriber provider and language that match your callers.  
   - For multilingual environments, consider translation.
4. **Enable translation where needed**  
   - If the working model language differs from user languages, enable translation and set `TranslationLanguage` appropriately.  
   - Test that translations preserve intent for your domain.
5. **Test cross-channel language behavior**  
   - Confirm that language behavior is consistent across voice, chat, email, and messaging channels.

## FAQ's

- **Can one agent handle multiple languages?**  
  Yes, using appropriate locale, transcriber, voice, and translation configuration; however, you may prefer separate agents for very different markets or personas.

- **How do I update language behavior for an existing agent?**  
  Adjust locale, voice, transcriber, and translation settings in Build, then test across all channels before deploying changes.

- **Where do language support lists live?**  
  Language support files and CSVs (for example in the repository’s language lists) document which languages are supported by which providers.
