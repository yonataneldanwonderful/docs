# Dynamic variables

Dynamic variables let you inject tenant- and context-specific data into prompts, messages, and flows without hard-coding values. In Wonderful, these are represented by global variables and other runtime metadata that can be referenced across agents and tools.

## Overview

Use dynamic variables when you need:

- Tenant-specific data (for example brand names, URLs, phone numbers).  
- Reusable configuration shared across agents and skills.  
- Safer personalization than hard-coding values into prompts or code.

Dynamic variables are typically stored as `GlobalVariable` records and combined with interaction context at runtime.

## How It Works

1. **Global variable definition**  
   - Each `GlobalVariable` is tenant-scoped and contains:
     - `Name`, `Description`.  
     - `Type` (string, number, boolean, JSON, enum).  
     - `Value` (stored as JSON) and optional enum options.
2. **Variable resolution**  
   - At runtime, the platform resolves global variables for the current tenant and makes them available to prompts and tools.  
   - Additional context (for example interaction metadata, tool outputs) can also be exposed as variables.
3. **Prompt and template substitution**  
   - Instruction blocks, tool prompts, and messages can reference variables by name.  
   - When building prompts, these placeholders are replaced with actual values for the current tenant and interaction.
4. **Safety and governance**  
   - Since variables are data, not code, they can be updated centrally for a tenant.  
   - Access can be controlled via roles and permissions in the UI.

## Components

- **GlobalVariable model**  
  - `Name`, `Description`: what the variable represents.  
  - `Type`: the value type.  
  - `Value`: the current value (JSON-encoded).  
  - `EnumOptions`: allowed values for enum-type variables.

- **Context variables**  
  - Interaction-level data (for example customer name, account ID) made available at runtime to prompts and tools.

- **Variable references**  
  - References inside instructions, templates, or tool configs that are resolved at runtime.

## Usage

1. **Define global variables for tenant-wide data**  
   - For example: support email, callback URL, brand tagline, default locale.
2. **Reference variables in instructions and messages**  
   - Use variable placeholders (as supported by the instruction/prompt system) instead of hard-coding values.  
   - Keep naming consistent across agents and skills.
3. **Use variables in tools**  
   - Pass global or context variables into tool parameters instead of literal values.  
   - This allows you to change behavior without editing tool definitions.
4. **Update values centrally**  
   - When tenant configuration changes (for example new callback URL), update the corresponding global variable rather than editing multiple prompts or tools.

## FAQ's

- **Are dynamic variables code?**  
  No. They’re data that can be read and injected into prompts and parameters, making behavior configurable instead of hard-coded.

- **Where are variables stored?**  
  Global variables are stored per tenant as `GlobalVariable` records; other variables come from interaction context and tool results.

- **How do I prevent leaking sensitive data via variables?**  
  Avoid storing secrets or PII directly in variables that are exposed to prompts; use secret management for credentials and follow PII logging rules for any user data.
