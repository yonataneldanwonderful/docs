# MCP tools

MCP tools let agents call tools exposed by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, such as external services, data sources, or internal utilities. They provide a standardized way to integrate rich tool ecosystems into Wonderful.

## Overview

MCP defines a protocol for:

- Discovering tools from MCP servers.  
- Describing tool schemas and parameters.  
- Invoking tools over a standardized interface.

In Wonderful, MCP tools are surfaced as tools agents can call through skills, similar to other tool types.

## How It Works

1. **MCP server registration**  
   - MCP servers are configured so Wonderful can connect to them and list available tools.
2. **Tool discovery**  
   - The platform queries MCP servers to discover tool definitions (names, parameters, descriptions).
3. **Tool mapping**  
   - Discovered MCP tools are mapped into Wonderful tool definitions, so they can be attached to skills and used by agents.
4. **Invocation at runtime**  
   - When the LLM chooses an MCP-backed tool, Wonderful:
     - Validates and prepares parameters.  
     - Invokes the MCP server’s tool endpoint.  
     - Returns results to the agent and logs usage for observability.

NOTE: Exact MCP server configuration and admin flows depend on deployment. Clarification required for full MCP server registration and management UX.

## Components

- **MCP servers**  
  - External or internal servers implementing the Model Context Protocol.

- **MCP tool definitions**  
  - Tool schemas describing name, parameters, and behavior as exposed by MCP servers.

- **Mapped tools in Wonderful**  
  - Tool records that wrap MCP tools, attached to skills and agents like any other tool.

## Usage

1. **Configure MCP servers**  
   - Register MCP servers that expose tools you want agents to use.
2. **Discover and map tools**  
   - Use the appropriate UI or API to import MCP tool definitions into Wonderful and map them to internal tools.
3. **Attach MCP tools to skills and agents**  
   - Place mapped MCP tools into skills and attach those skills to agents that should use them.
4. **Test and monitor**  
   - Run evals and test interactions that exercise MCP tools.  
   - Monitor tool performance, errors, and latency.

## FAQ's

- **How are MCP tools different from regular API tools?**  
  MCP tools are discovered and invoked via a standard protocol and server, while regular API tools are defined directly in Wonderful.

- **Can I restrict which agents can use MCP tools?**  
  Yes. Only skills and agents you attach MCP-backed tools to will be able to use them.

- **How are permissions handled?**  
  Permissions depend on MCP server configuration and any additional access control applied when mapping tools into Wonderful.
