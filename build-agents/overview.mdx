# Build

The Build section is where you design agents, wire up skills and tools, choose models and voice settings, and prepare configurations for production.

## Overview

<Info>
  Use **Build** when you want to change what an agent can do and how it behaves, before you focus on routing, monitoring, or governance surfaces.
</Info>

Building on the core concepts (agents, skills, tools, interactions), the Build area guides you through:

- **Designing agents**: choosing the right agent type, prompts, and capabilities.
- **Composing behavior**: attaching skills and tools, and deciding how they load at runtime.
- **Configuring runtime**: selecting models, voice & language, timeouts, PII, and governance options.
- **Connecting channels & auth**: wiring telephony, chat, email, WhatsApp, and integrations.
- **Preparing for launch**: setting up versioning, evals, and safe rollout patterns.

Use this section when you want to change **what an agent can do** and **how it behaves**, before you focus on routing and monitoring.

## How It Works

At a high level, the build workflow looks like this:

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the agent">
  Create an agent with a clear purpose, display name, and basic configuration (locale, voice, mode).
</Step>

<Step title="Write agent instructions">
  Define how the agent should think and act across channels, separate from skill prompts and tool descriptions.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach skills and tools">
  Reuse or create skills, attach them to the agent, and configure the tools that implement each capability.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure models, voice & language">
  Choose LLM providers and models, voice providers, and language/translation options appropriate for your use case.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect channels and authentication">
  Attach phone numbers, chat widgets, email routing, WhatsApp, and integrations so the agent can talk to real users and systems.
</Step>

<Step title="Version, test, and prepare for rollout">
  Use drafts, agent versions, and evals to validate behavior before publishing to production and handing off to Monitor.
</Step>
</Steps>

Build is tightly coupled to the underlying Go services (controller, runner, processor) and shared models, but exposes them through a workflow-oriented UI.

## Components

- **Agent types**  
  Decide what kind of agent you are building (for example support, sales, back-office) and which defaults it should inherit.

- **Agent instructions**  
  Author the agent-level prompt that defines persona, goals, and cross-skill behavior.

- **Models**  
  Configure LLM providers and models via `AgentLLMConfiguration`, including provider selection and model choice.

- **Skills**  
  Attach and manage skills that decompose behavior into focused capabilities, each with its own prompts and tools.

- **Agents (components & settings)**  
  Configure voice, transcriber, timeouts, PII, governance, and advanced settings that control runtime behavior.

- **Voice & language**  
  Choose voice providers, speed, style, denoiser models, and multi-language/translation options.

- **Tools**  
  Configure tools (API, RAG, programmable, mock) and how they are exposed to agents and skills, including low-code flows and integrations.

- **Personalization & authentication**  
  Set up dynamic variables and authentication/config to safely call external systems from tools.

## Usage

When working in Build, you typically:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start from a use case">
  Pick a concrete use case (for example “inbound support”, “renewals”, “collections”) and create an initial agent with type and instructions that match it.
</Step>

<Step title="Model capabilities as skills">
  Decompose the use case into skills and attach tools that implement those capabilities.
</Step>

<Step title="Tune models and voice">
  Choose models and voice settings for latency, accuracy, and language coverage appropriate for your region and channel mix.
</Step>

<Step title="Wire channels">
  Attach phone numbers, widgets, email addresses, or WhatsApp senders to the agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure PII, governance, and timeouts">
  Set PII, governance, and timeout settings to meet your compliance and CX requirements.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate before publishing">
  Run evals and manual tests on draft or versioned agents until you are satisfied, then publish and move to Monitor.
</Step>
</Steps>

As your catalog grows, reuse skills, tools, and patterns across agents rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Example: Build an inbound support agent

<Info>
  This example walks through building a **voice + chat inbound support agent** using the main Build pages, mirroring how you’d structure an agent in Agent Studio–style flows.
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the agent">
  In the Agents area, create a new agent (for example <code>Support - Inbound</code>) with the correct tenant, locale, and default mode.
</Step>

<Step title="Pick an agent type and instructions">
  Use <code>Agent types</code> to frame this as an inbound support agent, then author clear agent instructions that define scope (what this agent can and cannot do), escalation rules, and tone.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach core skills and tools">
  Create or reuse skills such as authentication, FAQ/help, ticket creation, and account updates, and attach them to the agent with the appropriate tools (CRM, ticketing, knowledge base, payment providers).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure models, voice & language">
  Choose a model suitable for real-time support, configure voice (provider, voice, speed, style) and language/translation options for your primary markets.
</Step>

<Step title="Wire channels">
  Attach at least one phone number and one chat widget to the agent so customers can reach it over voice and web chat; verify routing via the Manage/Deploy docs.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable governance and PII, then test">
  Turn on appropriate PII and governance settings, run evals and manual tests across typical support scenarios, then publish once you’re satisfied with behavior.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where should I start when building my first agent?">
    Begin with a single agent, define its instructions and a small set of skills and tools, then add channels and evals once basic behavior is solid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I create a new agent vs a new skill?">
    Create a new agent when the purpose, governance, or channel mix is meaningfully different; add a new skill when you’re expanding capabilities within the same domain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I have to finish all Build steps before going live?">
    No. You can launch with a minimal configuration (one channel, few skills, default model) and layer in more skills, tools, channels, and governance as you iterate.
  </Accordion>
