## Tag Libraries

Tag libraries are collections of reusable tags organized by domain or use case. They provide standardized tagging across your organization.

## Purpose

Tag libraries enable:
- **Standardization** — Consistent tags across agents and teams
- **Reusability** — Share tags across multiple use cases
- **Organization** — Group related tags together
- **Documentation** — Centralized tag definitions and usage

## Library Organization

Libraries can be organized by:
- **Domain** — Customer support, sales, operations
- **Use case** — Escalations, outcomes, intents
- **Team** — Department or team-specific tags
- **Function** — Analytics, routing, compliance

## Using Tag Libraries

Apply tag libraries to:
- **Agents** — Use library tags in agent configurations
- **Skills** — Apply library tags to skills
- **Tools** — Tag tools with library tags
- **Interactions** — Use library tags for interaction tagging

## Library Management

Manage tag libraries by:
- **Creating libraries** — Define new tag collections
- **Adding tags** — Add tags to libraries
- **Organizing** — Group and categorize tags
- **Documenting** — Document tag purpose and usage
- **Sharing** — Share libraries across teams

## Best Practices

- **Start small** — Begin with essential tags
- **Document clearly** — Define what each tag means
- **Keep organized** — Maintain clear organization
- **Review regularly** — Update libraries as needs change
- **Share widely** — Make libraries available to all teams

Tag libraries promote consistency and standardization across your organization's tagging strategy.
