## Deterministic Tags

Deterministic tags are applied based on rules that evaluate events. These rules provide 100% consistency and real-time application.

## How Deterministic Tags Work

Deterministic tags use event rules:
1. **Events occur** — System events are generated
2. **Rules evaluate** — Rules check if conditions are met
3. **Tags apply** — Tags are applied immediately when rules match
4. **Consistent results** — Same events always produce same tags

## Event Rules

Rules can trigger tags when:
- **Skill loaded** — Specific skill is activated
- **Tool called** — Particular tool is executed
- **Error codes** — Specific error codes occur
- **Escalations** — Escalation events happen
- **State changes** — Interaction state changes
- **Any system event** — Any event matching rule conditions

## Rule Syntax

Rules define conditions and actions:
- **Conditions** — When the rule should trigger
- **Actions** — What tags to apply
- **Logic** — AND/OR combinations of conditions

## Benefits

Deterministic tags provide:
- **100% consistency** — Same events always produce same tags
- **Real-time** — Tags applied immediately as events occur
- **Cost-effective** — No LLM calls required
- **Debuggable** — Clear rules make it easy to understand why tags were applied
- **Reliable metrics** — Consistent tagging ensures accurate analytics

## Examples

- Tool `send_sms` succeeds → tag `sms_sent`
- Skill `cancel_card` loaded → tag `credit_card`
- Agent escalates → tag `escalation`
- Error code `PAYMENT_FAILED` → tag `payment_issue`
- Tool `create_ticket` called → tag `support_ticket_created`

## Best Practices

- **Use for clear cases** — Apply when conditions are unambiguous
- **Combine with LLM tags** — Use both for comprehensive tagging
- **Document rules** — Clearly document rule logic
- **Test thoroughly** — Validate rules work as expected
- **Monitor application** — Track tag application patterns

Deterministic tags are ideal for clear, event-driven tagging that requires consistency and reliability.
