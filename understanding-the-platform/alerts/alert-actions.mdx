## Monitor Actions Overview

Monitor actions define what happens when a monitor triggers. Actions send notifications to team members via various channels to ensure timely response to issues.

**Note**: Monitors only send notifications. They do not trigger automated responses or actions beyond sending email and SMS notifications.

## Action Types

### Email

Send email notifications to specific email addresses.

**Type**: `email`

**Value**: Email address (e.g., `team@example.com`)

**Use Cases**:
- Notify specific team members
- Send to distribution lists
- Alert external stakeholders

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "value": "ops-team@example.com"
}
```

### SMS

Send SMS notifications to phone numbers.

**Type**: `sms`

**Value**: Phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`)

**Use Cases**:
- Critical alerts requiring immediate attention
- On-call notifications
- Mobile team notifications

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "sms",
  "value": "+1234567890"
}
```

**Note**: SMS requires Twilio configuration and may incur costs.

### User Email

Send email notifications to platform users by user ID.

**Type**: `user_email`

**Value**: User ID (UUID)

**Use Cases**:
- Notify specific team members by their platform account
- Alert users based on their role
- Send to users who created the alert

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "user_email",
  "value": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

**Note**: The system resolves the user ID to their email address automatically.

### Group Email

Send email notifications to all members of a user group.

**Type**: `group_email`

**Value**: Group ID (UUID)

**Use Cases**:
- Notify entire teams
- Alert groups based on responsibility
- Send to multiple people without managing individual addresses

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "group_email",
  "value": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
}
```

**Note**: The system resolves the group ID to all member email addresses automatically.

## Multiple Actions

Alerts can have multiple actions. All actions are executed when an alert triggers:

**Example**:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "email",
    "value": "ops-team@example.com"
  },
  {
    "type": "sms",
    "value": "+1234567890"
  },
  {
    "type": "group_email",
    "value": "on-call-group-id"
  }
]
```

This sends email to the ops team, SMS to the on-call person, and email to the on-call group.

## Notification Content

### Email Notifications

Email notifications include:

- **Subject**: "Alert: [Alert Name]" or "Alert Resolved: [Alert Name]"
- **Alert Name**: The name of the alert
- **Condition**: Human-readable description of the trigger condition
- **Severity**: Alert severity (High, Medium, Low)
- **Current Value**: The metric value that triggered the alert
- **Triggered/Resolved Time**: When the incident was triggered or resolved
- **Tool Function**: If applicable, which tool is being monitored
- **Incident ID**: Unique identifier for the incident

Emails are formatted as HTML with clear visual indicators (🚨 for triggered, ✅ for resolved).

### SMS Notifications

SMS notifications include:

- **Prefix**: "🚨 Alert" or "✅ Alert Resolved"
- **Alert Name**: The name of the alert
- **Condition**: Brief description of the trigger condition
- **Current Value**: The metric value
- **Severity**: Alert severity
- **Tool Function**: If applicable, which tool is being monitored

SMS messages are concise to fit within message limits.

## Notification Timing

### Initial Notification

Notifications are sent immediately when:
- A new incident is created (alert triggers)
- The alert condition is met for the first time
- No open incident exists (or window has passed)

### Reminder Notifications

If `ReminderFrequencyMinutes` is set (> 0), additional notifications are sent:
- At the specified interval while the incident remains open
- Only for unresolved incidents
- Helps ensure incidents don't go unnoticed

**Example**: If `ReminderFrequencyMinutes = 60`, reminders are sent every hour until the incident is resolved.

### Resolution Notifications

If `NotifyOnResolvedIncidents` is enabled:
- A notification is sent when the incident is resolved
- Subject line indicates "Alert Resolved"
- Includes resolution time and final metric value

## Action Configuration

Actions are configured when creating or updating an alert:

```json
{
  "alert_actions": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "value": "team@example.com"
    },
    {
      "type": "user_email",
      "value": "user-id-here"
    }
  ],
  "reminder_frequency_minutes": 60,
  "notify_on_resolved_incidents": true
}
```

## Best Practices

### Action Selection

- **Use email for most alerts**: Email is reliable and provides detailed information
- **Use SMS for critical alerts**: Reserve SMS for alerts requiring immediate action
- **Use groups for teams**: Group email simplifies managing team notifications
- **Combine channels**: Use multiple actions for important alerts (email + SMS)

### Reminder Configuration

- **Set reminders for high-severity alerts**: Ensure critical issues don't go unnoticed
- **Balance frequency**: Too frequent = annoying, too infrequent = missed incidents
- **Consider business hours**: Adjust reminder frequency based on when alerts are active

### Resolution Notifications

- **Enable for important alerts**: Get notified when issues are resolved
- **Disable for noisy alerts**: Avoid notification fatigue for low-priority alerts

### Testing Actions

- **Test email addresses**: Verify email addresses are correct
- **Test phone numbers**: Ensure SMS numbers are in correct format
- **Verify group membership**: Confirm groups have the right members
- **Check notification content**: Review email/SMS content for clarity

## Notification Delivery

- **Email**: Delivered via Resend email service
- **SMS**: Delivered via Twilio SMS service
- **User/Group Email**: Resolved to email addresses and sent via Resend

Notifications are sent asynchronously and failures are logged but don't prevent alert processing.
