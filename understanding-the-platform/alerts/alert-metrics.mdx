## Alert Metrics Overview

Alerts can monitor various metrics that track agent performance, interaction quality, and system health. Each metric measures a specific aspect of your agents' behavior.

## Available Metrics

### ActiveInteractions

**Description**: Count of interactions currently in progress

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor system load
- Detect when no interactions are occurring
- Track peak usage times

**Example**: Alert when active interactions drop to 0 for 30 minutes (system may be down)

### TotalInteractions

**Description**: Total count of interactions in the time window

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor interaction volume
- Detect unusual spikes or drops
- Track business hours activity

**Example**: Alert when total interactions exceed 1000 in the last hour (high volume)

### Duration

**Description**: Interaction duration (in milliseconds)

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor interaction length
- Detect unusually long interactions
- Track average handling time

**Example**: Alert when average duration exceeds 10 minutes (interactions taking too long)

**Note**: Duration values are in milliseconds. The estimator determines how duration is calculated (average, maximum, etc.)

### ForwardAmount

**Description**: Count of interactions that were escalated/forwarded to human agents

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor escalation volume
- Detect when too many interactions require human intervention
- Track escalation trends

**Example**: Alert when forward amount exceeds 50 in the last hour (high escalation rate)

### ForwardPercentage

**Description**: Percentage of interactions that were escalated/forwarded

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor escalation rate
- Detect when agent effectiveness drops
- Track quality metrics

**Example**: Alert when forward percentage exceeds 20% (agent struggling)

**Note**: Percentage values range from 0 to 100

### ToolFailure

**Description**: Count of tool execution failures

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor tool reliability
- Detect when tools are failing frequently
- Track integration health

**Example**: Alert when tool failures exceed 10 in the last 10 minutes (tool issues)

**Note**: Can be filtered by specific tool name (see Tool-Specific Alerts)

### ToolApplicationFailure

**Description**: Count of tool application/validation failures

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor tool parameter validation
- Detect when tools are being called incorrectly
- Track agent tool usage issues

**Example**: Alert when tool application failures exceed 5 in the last hour (agent configuration issues)

## Metric Filtering

Some metrics support filtering:

### Agent Filtering

All metrics can be filtered by `AgentID` to monitor specific agents:

- Monitor a single agent's performance
- Compare different agents
- Track agent-specific issues

### Tool Filtering

`ToolFailure` and `ToolApplicationFailure` metrics support filtering by `ToolName`:

- Monitor specific tool reliability
- Track tool-specific issues
- Alert on critical tool failures

## Estimators

Metrics are calculated using estimators that determine how values are aggregated:

### Average

Calculates the mean value across all data points in the window.

**Best for**: Understanding typical performance, general trends

**Example**: Average duration of 5 minutes means interactions typically take 5 minutes

### Minimum

Returns the smallest value in the window.

**Best for**: Finding best-case scenarios, detecting when minimums drop

**Example**: Minimum duration of 30 seconds (fastest interaction)

### Maximum

Returns the largest value in the window.

**Best for**: Finding worst-case scenarios, detecting outliers

**Example**: Maximum duration of 45 minutes (longest interaction)

### 95th Percentile

Returns the value at the 95th percentile (95% of values are below this).

**Best for**: Understanding typical worst-case performance, excluding outliers

**Example**: 95th percentile duration of 8 minutes (95% of interactions complete within 8 minutes)

### LastValue

Returns the most recent value from the last 10 minutes.

**Best for**: Real-time monitoring, current state tracking

**Example**: Last value of active interactions = 5 (currently 5 active interactions)

## Time Windows

Metrics are calculated over a time window defined by:

- **Window Value** — Numeric value (e.g., 10, 1, 30)
- **Time Unit** — Minutes, Hours, or Days

**Examples**:
- Last 10 minutes
- Last 1 hour
- Last 7 days

The time window determines how far back to look when calculating the metric value.

## Choosing Metrics

**For Volume Monitoring**: Use `TotalInteractions` or `ActiveInteractions`

**For Performance Monitoring**: Use `Duration` with Average or 95th Percentile estimator

**For Quality Monitoring**: Use `ForwardPercentage` or `ForwardAmount`

**For Reliability Monitoring**: Use `ToolFailure` or `ToolApplicationFailure`

**For Real-Time Monitoring**: Use `LastValue` estimator with short time windows

## Best Practices

- **Choose appropriate estimators**: Use Average for general trends, 95th Percentile for worst-case, LastValue for real-time
- **Set reasonable time windows**: Too short = noisy, too long = slow to detect issues
- **Filter when needed**: Use agent or tool filtering to focus on specific areas
- **Combine metrics**: Create multiple alerts for different aspects of performance
- **Test thresholds**: Start with conservative thresholds and adjust based on actual data
