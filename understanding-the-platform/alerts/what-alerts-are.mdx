## What Alerts Are

Alerts are automated monitoring and notification systems that track agent performance metrics and notify you when conditions are met. They help you proactively identify issues, monitor system health, and respond to performance degradation.

Alerts continuously monitor metrics from your agents and interactions, evaluate them against trigger conditions, and send notifications when thresholds are exceeded.

## Why Alerts Exist

Alerts provide several key benefits:

- **Proactive Monitoring** — Get notified about issues before they impact users
- **Performance Tracking** — Monitor key metrics automatically
- **Incident Management** — Track and resolve alert incidents
- **Team Notifications** — Keep your team informed via email and SMS
- **Scheduled Monitoring** — Monitor only during business hours if needed
- **Automated Response** — Trigger actions when alerts fire

## Alert Components

Each alert consists of:

- **Metric** — What to monitor (e.g., tool failures, interaction duration)
- **Estimator** — How to calculate the metric (e.g., average, maximum, 95th percentile)
- **Time Window** — How far back to look (e.g., last 10 minutes, last 1 hour)
- **Trigger Conditions** — When to fire the alert (e.g., value > threshold)
- **Severity** — Alert priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Actions** — What to do when triggered (email, SMS notifications)
- **Schedule** — When the alert is active (optional)

## Alert Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — Define metric, conditions, and actions
2. **Activation** — Alert becomes active and starts monitoring
3. **Evaluation** — Scheduler checks conditions at configured intervals
4. **Triggering** — When conditions are met, an incident is created
5. **Notification** — Alert actions are executed (emails, SMS sent)
6. **Resolution** — Incident is resolved when conditions no longer match
7. **Reminders** — Optional reminders sent while incident is open

## Alert Examples

Common alert use cases:

- **High Tool Failure Rate** — Alert when tool failures exceed 5% in the last hour
- **Long Interaction Duration** — Alert when average interaction duration exceeds 10 minutes
- **High Escalation Rate** — Alert when escalation percentage exceeds 20%
- **No Active Interactions** — Alert when no interactions occur for 30 minutes
- **Tool-Specific Failures** — Alert when a specific tool fails more than 3 times in 10 minutes

## Alert Status

Alerts can be:

- **Active** — Currently monitoring and evaluating conditions
- **Inactive** — Temporarily disabled (not monitoring)
- **Deleted** — Soft-deleted (marked as deleted but retained for history)
