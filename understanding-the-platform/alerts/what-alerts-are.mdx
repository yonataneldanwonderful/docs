## What Monitors Are

Monitors (also called alerts) are automated notification systems that evaluate agent performance metrics and notify you when conditions are met. They help you proactively identify issues and stay informed about system health.

Monitors continuously evaluate metrics from your agents and interactions against trigger conditions, and send notifications when thresholds are exceeded.

## Why Monitors Exist

Monitors provide several key benefits:

- **Proactive Notifications** — Get notified about issues before they impact users
- **Issue Detection** — Automatically detect when metrics exceed thresholds
- **Incident Management** — Track and resolve monitor incidents
- **Team Notifications** — Keep your team informed via email and SMS
- **Scheduled Monitoring** — Monitor only during business hours if needed

## Monitor Components

Each monitor consists of:

- **Metric** — What to monitor (e.g., tool failures, interaction duration)
- **Estimator** — How to calculate the metric (e.g., average, maximum, 95th percentile)
- **Time Window** — How far back to look (e.g., last 10 minutes, last 1 hour)
- **Trigger Conditions** — When to fire the monitor (e.g., value > threshold)
- **Severity** — Monitor priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Actions** — What to do when triggered (email, SMS notifications)
- **Schedule** — When the monitor is active (optional)
- **Agent Filter** — Optional agent ID to monitor a specific agent

## Monitor Scope

Monitors can be configured at different levels:

### Tenant-Level Monitors

Monitor metrics across all agents in your tenant. Leave `AgentID` empty or null.

**Use Cases**:
- System-wide health monitoring
- Overall performance tracking
- Tenant-level metrics

### Agent-Level Monitors

Monitor metrics for a specific agent. Set `AgentID` to the agent's ID.

**Use Cases**:
- Agent-specific performance monitoring
- Individual agent health checks
- Compare different agents

## Monitor Examples

Common monitor use cases:

- **High Tool Failure Rate** — Monitor when tool failures exceed 5% in the last hour
- **Long Interaction Duration** — Monitor when average interaction duration exceeds 10 minutes
- **High Escalation Rate** — Monitor when escalation percentage exceeds 20%
- **No Active Interactions** — Monitor when no interactions occur for 30 minutes
- **Tool-Specific Failures** — Monitor when a specific tool fails more than 3 times in 10 minutes
- **Agent-Specific Issues** — Monitor a specific agent's performance metrics

## Monitor Status

Monitors can be:

- **Active** — Currently monitoring and evaluating conditions
- **Inactive** — Temporarily disabled (not monitoring)
- **Deleted** — Soft-deleted (marked as deleted but retained for history)
