## Monitor Schedules Overview

Monitor schedules allow you to control when monitors are active and monitoring. This enables monitors to only run during business hours, specific days, or custom time ranges.

## What Are Schedules

Schedules define time windows when alerts should be active. Outside of scheduled times, alerts are inactive and won't trigger incidents, even if conditions are met.

## Schedule Structure

Schedules are defined as an array of schedule entries, where each entry specifies:

- **Weekday** — Which day of the week (Sunday through Saturday)
- **Time Range** — Start and end times for that day

## Schedule Entry

Each schedule entry contains:

```json
{
  "week_day": "Monday",
  "start_time": "09:00",
  "end_time": "17:00"
}
```

- **week_day**: One of: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
- **start_time**: 24-hour format time (e.g., "09:00", "14:30")
- **end_time**: 24-hour format time (e.g., "17:00", "22:00")

## Schedule Examples

### Business Hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM)

```json
[
  {
    "week_day": "Monday",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Tuesday",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Wednesday",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Thursday",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Friday",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "17:00"
  }
]
```

### Extended Hours (Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 8 PM)

```json
[
  {
    "week_day": "Monday",
    "start_time": "08:00",
    "end_time": "20:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Tuesday",
    "start_time": "08:00",
    "end_time": "20:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Wednesday",
    "start_time": "08:00",
    "end_time": "20:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Thursday",
    "start_time": "08:00",
    "end_time": "20:00"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Friday",
    "start_time": "08:00",
    "end_time": "20:00"
  }
]
```

### 24/7 Monitoring

```json
[
  {
    "week_day": "Sunday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Monday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Tuesday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Wednesday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Thursday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Friday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Saturday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  }
]
```

### Weekend Only

```json
[
  {
    "week_day": "Saturday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  },
  {
    "week_day": "Sunday",
    "start_time": "00:00",
    "end_time": "23:59"
  }
]
```

## Schedule Behavior

### Active Periods

During scheduled times:
- Alert is active and monitoring
- Conditions are evaluated at configured intervals
- Incidents can be created if conditions are met
- Notifications are sent

### Inactive Periods

Outside scheduled times:
- Alert is inactive
- Conditions are not evaluated
- No incidents are created
- No notifications are sent
- Existing open incidents remain open

### Timezone Handling

Schedules use the system timezone. Ensure your schedule times match your intended timezone.

## Schedule Configuration

Schedules are optional. If no schedule is provided:

- Alert is active 24/7
- Monitors continuously
- No time-based restrictions

To disable scheduling, set `ActiveSchedule` to `null` or omit it.

## Use Cases

### Business Hours Monitoring

Monitor only during business hours to:
- Reduce noise from off-hours activity
- Focus on peak usage times
- Align with team availability

### Critical Alerts 24/7

Keep critical alerts active 24/7:
- System health monitoring
- Security alerts
- Critical tool failures

### Different Schedules for Different Alerts

Use different schedules for different alert types:
- Business hours for performance alerts
- 24/7 for critical system alerts
- Extended hours for customer-facing alerts

## Best Practices

### Schedule Design

- **Match business needs**: Align schedules with when issues matter most
- **Consider team availability**: Schedule alerts when team can respond
- **Account for timezones**: Ensure schedule times match your timezone
- **Test schedules**: Verify alerts activate/deactivate at expected times

### Combining with Other Settings

- **Use with reminders**: Reminders only sent during active periods
- **Combine with severity**: High-severity alerts might need 24/7, low-severity can be business hours
- **Consider resolution notifications**: Resolution notifications sent even if alert becomes inactive

### Common Patterns

**Business Hours Only**:
- Performance monitoring
- Quality metrics
- Non-critical alerts

**24/7 Monitoring**:
- System health
- Critical tool failures
- Security-related alerts

**Extended Hours**:
- Customer-facing services
- Peak usage periods
- Support team coverage

## Schedule Limitations

- **No timezone per alert**: All alerts use system timezone
- **No holidays**: Schedules don't account for holidays (use manual activation/deactivation)
- **No complex patterns**: Limited to weekday + time range (no "first Monday of month" etc.)

For more complex scheduling needs, consider:
- Manually activating/deactivating alerts
- Using multiple alerts with different schedules
- External scheduling systems
