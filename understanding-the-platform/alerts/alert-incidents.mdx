## Alert Incidents Overview

An alert incident is created when an alert's trigger conditions are met. Incidents track individual alert events, their status, and resolution.

## What Are Incidents

Incidents represent a single occurrence of an alert condition being met. Each incident records:

- **When it was triggered** — Timestamp of when conditions were met
- **Metric value** — The actual metric value that triggered the alert
- **Status** — Whether the incident is open or resolved
- **Resolution** — When and by whom it was resolved (if resolved)

## Incident Lifecycle

### 1. Triggered

An incident is created when:
- Alert conditions evaluate to true
- No open incident exists for this alert
- OR the time window has passed since the last incident

**Triggered At**: Timestamp when incident was created

### 2. Open

The incident remains open while:
- Alert conditions continue to be met
- OR conditions are no longer met but incident hasn't been resolved

**Status**: `Open`

### 3. Resolved

The incident is resolved when:
- Alert conditions are no longer met (automatic resolution)
- OR manually resolved by a user

**Status**: `Resolved`
**Resolved At**: Timestamp when incident was resolved
**Resolved By**: User ID who resolved it (if manual)

## Incident Status

### Open

Incident is currently active. The alert condition is (or was) met.

- Notifications are sent (initial + reminders if configured)
- Incident appears in active incidents list
- Can be manually resolved

### Resolved

Incident has been resolved. The alert condition is no longer met.

- Resolution notification sent (if configured)
- Incident appears in resolved incidents list
- Can be reviewed for historical analysis

## Incident Data

Each incident stores:

- **Alert ID** — Which alert triggered this incident
- **Agent ID** — Which agent this relates to (if alert is agent-specific)
- **Metric Value** — The calculated metric value that triggered the alert
- **Triggered At** — When the incident was created
- **Status** — Open or Resolved
- **Resolved At** — When resolved (if resolved)
- **Resolved By** — Who resolved it (if manual resolution)
- **Last Notification Sent At** — When the last reminder was sent

## Incident Creation Rules

### New Incident Creation

A new incident is created when:

1. Alert is active
2. Alert conditions evaluate to true
3. **AND** one of:
   - No previous incidents exist for this alert
   - Last incident is resolved
   - Time window has passed since last incident (`WindowValue` + `TimeUnit`)

### Preventing Duplicate Incidents

The system prevents creating duplicate incidents:

- **Open incidents block new ones**: If an open incident exists, no new incident is created
- **Window-based deduplication**: New incidents are only created after the time window passes
- **Automatic resolution**: When conditions are no longer met, open incidents are automatically resolved

## Automatic Resolution

Incidents are automatically resolved when:

- Alert conditions are no longer met (e.g., metric value drops below threshold)
- Alert is deactivated
- Alert is deleted

**Resolution Time**: When conditions first evaluate to false
**Resolved By**: System (automatic)

## Manual Resolution

Incidents can be manually resolved by users:

- Mark incident as resolved in the UI
- Useful when issue is addressed but conditions haven't changed yet
- Allows tracking of manual intervention

**Resolution Time**: When user marks as resolved
**Resolved By**: User ID of the person who resolved it

## Incident Notifications

### Initial Notification

Sent when incident is created:
- All alert actions are executed
- Email/SMS sent to all configured recipients
- Includes incident details and metric value

### Reminder Notifications

Sent while incident is open (if `ReminderFrequencyMinutes` > 0):
- Sent at configured intervals
- Helps ensure incidents don't go unnoticed
- Stops when incident is resolved

### Resolution Notification

Sent when incident is resolved (if `NotifyOnResolvedIncidents` is enabled):
- Notifies that the issue is resolved
- Includes resolution time
- Confirms system is back to normal

## Incident Filtering

Incidents can be filtered by:

- **Alert** — Show incidents for specific alerts
- **Agent** — Show incidents for specific agents
- **Status** — Open or Resolved
- **Time Range** — When incidents were triggered
- **Severity** — Alert severity level

## Incident History

Incident history provides:

- **Trend Analysis** — How often alerts trigger
- **Resolution Time** — How long incidents stay open
- **Pattern Recognition** — Common triggers and times
- **Alert Tuning** — Data to adjust alert thresholds

## Best Practices

### Incident Management

- **Review regularly**: Check open incidents and resolve manually if needed
- **Analyze patterns**: Look for recurring incidents to identify root causes
- **Tune alerts**: Adjust thresholds based on incident frequency
- **Document resolutions**: Note why incidents occurred and how they were resolved

### Resolution Strategy

- **Automatic resolution**: Let system resolve when conditions improve
- **Manual resolution**: Resolve manually when issue is addressed but conditions unchanged
- **Investigation**: Use incident data to investigate root causes

### Alert Tuning

- **Too many incidents**: Increase thresholds or adjust conditions
- **Too few incidents**: Decrease thresholds or check if alerts are working
- **False positives**: Refine conditions to be more specific
- **Missed issues**: Lower thresholds or add additional alerts
