## What Interactions Are

An interaction is a single conversation between an agent and a real user. Interactions capture the complete context of a conversation, including the dialogue, actions taken, and outcomes.

## Interaction Types

### Inbound

Interactions where the customer contacts the agent:
- Customer initiates the conversation
- Agent responds to customer requests
- Examples: support requests, appointment bookings, account inquiries

### Outbound

Interactions where the agent contacts the customer:
- Agent initiates the conversation
- Agent reaches out proactively
- Examples: appointment reminders, follow-up calls, proactive support

## Interaction Channels

Interactions can occur across multiple channels:

- **Voice** — Phone calls via SIP or phone numbers
- **Chat** — Web chat widgets and embedded chat
- **Email** — Email-based conversations

All channels share the same agent logic, with differences only in formatting and input handling.
