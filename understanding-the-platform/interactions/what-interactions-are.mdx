## What Interactions Are

An interaction is a single conversation between an agent and a real user. Interactions capture the complete context of a conversation, including the dialogue, actions taken, and outcomes.

## Interaction Types

### Inbound

Interactions where the customer contacts the agent:
- Customer initiates the conversation
- Agent responds to customer requests
- Examples: support requests, appointment bookings, account inquiries

### Outbound

Interactions where the agent contacts the customer:
- Agent initiates the conversation
- Agent reaches out proactively
- Examples: appointment reminders, follow-up calls, proactive support

## Interaction Channels

Interactions can occur across multiple channels:

- **Voice** — Phone calls via SIP or phone numbers
- **Chat** — Web chat widgets and embedded chat
- **Email** — Email-based conversations
- **WhatsApp** — WhatsApp messaging

All channels share the same agent logic, with differences only in formatting and input handling.

## What Interactions Include

Interactions (stored as `Communication` records) capture comprehensive information:

- **Conversation transcript** — Full dialogue between agent and user (stored as `BaseTranscript` records)
- **Tool calls** — All tools executed during the interaction with parameters and results
- **Skill loads** — Which skills were loaded and when
- **Events** — System events that occurred during the interaction
- **Tags** — LLM and deterministic tags applied (stored via many-to-many relationship)
- **Call Tags** — System-generated tags for call characteristics
- **Metrics** — Duration, escalations, outcomes, and performance data
- **Sentiment** — Customer sentiment analysis
- **Rating** — Call rating and quality scores
- **Summary** — Brief and detailed summaries of the interaction
- **Tokens Usage** — LLM token consumption statistics
- **Recording URLs** — Links to audio recordings (original, processed, masked)
- **Metadata** — Additional custom metadata (e.g., who ended the call, forwarding information)
- **Human Feedback** — Manual review and feedback from human reviewers
- **Review Status** — Whether the interaction has been reviewed and by whom

## Interaction Purpose

Interactions serve multiple purposes:

- **Record keeping** — Complete history of customer interactions
- **Analytics** — Understand agent performance and user behavior
- **Debugging** — Troubleshoot issues and understand agent decisions
- **Training** — Improve agents based on real interactions
- **Compliance** — Maintain records for regulatory requirements
- **Quality Assurance** — Review and rate interactions for quality
- **Performance Monitoring** — Track metrics and KPIs
- **Audit Trail** — Complete record of all actions and events

## Interaction Status

Interactions have a status that indicates their current state:

- **Active** — Interaction is currently in progress
- **Completed** — Interaction finished successfully
- **Failed** — Interaction ended due to an error
- **Escalated** — Interaction was transferred to a human agent

## Interaction Direction

Interactions can be:

- **Inbound** — Customer initiates contact (from customer to agent)
- **Outbound** — Agent initiates contact (from agent to customer)

The direction affects how phone numbers are interpreted (from_number vs to_number).

## Interaction Metadata

Interactions store metadata that provides additional context:

- **Ended By** — Who ended the interaction (customer, agent, or system)
- **Forwarded To** — If escalated, where it was forwarded
- **Session ID** — Unique identifier for the interaction session
- **Agent Version** — Which version of the agent handled this interaction
- **Custom Fields** — Tenant-specific metadata

## Interaction Recordings

For voice interactions, multiple recording versions may be available:

- **Original Recording** — Raw audio recording
- **Processed Recording** — Enhanced/processed audio
- **Masked Recording** — Audio with PII masked (if PII masking is enabled)
- **Masked MP3** — Masked audio in MP3 format

Recordings are stored in S3 and accessible via signed URLs.
