## Interaction Lifecycle

Interactions follow a lifecycle from initiation to completion, with various stages and transitions.

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Initiation

The interaction begins when:
- **Inbound**: Customer contacts the agent (calls, chats, emails)
- **Outbound**: Agent initiates contact with customer

At initiation, the agent loads and begins processing the request.

### 2. Active Conversation

During the active conversation:
- Agent and user exchange messages
- Skills load dynamically as needed
- Tools execute to perform actions
- Events are generated and tracked
- Tags are applied based on context and rules

The agent makes decisions, calls tools, and loads skills to accomplish the user's goal.

### 3. Resolution

The interaction reaches resolution when:
- The user's request is fulfilled
- The agent successfully completes the task
- An escalation occurs
- The user ends the conversation
- A timeout or error occurs

### 4. Completion

Upon completion:
- Final tags are applied
- Metrics are calculated
- The interaction is recorded
- Analytics are updated
- Follow-up actions may be triggered

## State Transitions

Interactions can transition between states:

- **Active** → **Paused** (user temporarily inactive)
- **Active** → **Escalated** (transferred to human)
- **Active** → **Completed** (successful resolution)
- **Active** → **Failed** (error or timeout)
- **Paused** → **Active** (user returns)
- **Escalated** → **Completed** (human resolves)

## Lifecycle Events

Key events during the lifecycle:

- **Interaction started** — Initial contact established
- **Skill loaded** — Dynamic skill activation
- **Tool called** — Action execution
- **Tag applied** — Behavior annotation
- **Escalation** — Transfer to human
- **Resolution** — Task completion
- **Interaction ended** — Conversation closed

## Monitoring the Lifecycle

Track interactions through their lifecycle to:
- Understand where interactions get stuck
- Identify common failure points
- Optimize agent behavior
- Improve user experience
- Measure success rates
