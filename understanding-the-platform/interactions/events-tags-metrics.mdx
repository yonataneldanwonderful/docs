## Events

Events are system occurrences that happen during an interaction. They track:
- Skill loading and unloading
- Tool calls and their outcomes
- Error conditions
- Escalations
- State changes
- User actions

Events enable deterministic behavior and provide a complete audit trail of what happened during an interaction.

## Tags

Tags are yes/no markers applied to interactions or individual turns. They come from two sources:

### LLM Tags

Generated through prompt-based inference. The agent analyzes conversation context and applies tags based on its understanding.

### Deterministic Tags

Applied based on rules that evaluate events. They provide 100% consistency and real-time application.

Tags enable:
- **Analytics** — Track patterns and outcomes
- **Routing** — Direct conversations based on characteristics
- **Behavior tracking** — Monitor how agents handle scenarios
- **Product logic** — Trigger downstream actions

## Metrics

Metrics provide quantitative measures of interaction performance:

- **Duration** — How long the interaction lasted
- **Escalations** — Whether and when escalation occurred
- **Outcomes** — Success, failure, or other outcomes
- **Tool usage** — Which tools were called and how often
- **Skill usage** — Which skills were loaded
- **Tag distribution** — Which tags were applied
- **User satisfaction** — Feedback and ratings

## Using Interaction Data

Interaction data enables:

- **Performance analysis** — Understand agent effectiveness
- **Pattern recognition** — Identify common issues or requests
- **Optimization** — Improve agent behavior based on data
- **Reporting** — Generate insights for stakeholders
- **Debugging** — Troubleshoot specific issues
