## Events

Events are system occurrences that happen during an interaction. They track:
- Skill loading and unloading
- Tool calls and their outcomes
- Error conditions
- Escalations
- State changes
- User actions
- Transcription events
- Agent responses
- System actions

Events enable deterministic behavior and provide a complete audit trail of what happened during an interaction.

### Event Bus Architecture

The platform uses an event bus system for event propagation:

- **Event Types** — Different event types for different system occurrences
- **Event Groups** — Events are organized into groups (e.g., by tenant, by interaction)
- **Publish/Subscribe** — Components can publish events and subscribe to event types
- **Asynchronous Processing** — Events can be published asynchronously for performance
- **Event Handlers** — Handlers process events and trigger actions (e.g., tag application)

### Event Structure

Events contain:
- **Type** — The event type identifier
- **Data** — Event-specific data payload
- **Metadata** — Additional context and metadata
- **Source Worker ID** — Which worker/component generated the event

Events are published to the event bus and can trigger deterministic tag rules, logging, analytics, and other downstream processes.

## Tags

Tags are yes/no markers applied to interactions or individual turns. They come from two sources:

### LLM Tags

Generated through prompt-based inference. The agent analyzes conversation context and applies tags based on its understanding.

### Deterministic Tags

Applied based on rules that evaluate events. They provide 100% consistency and real-time application.

Tags enable:
- **Analytics** — Track patterns and outcomes
- **Routing** — Direct conversations based on characteristics
- **Behavior tracking** — Monitor how agents handle scenarios
- **Product logic** — Trigger downstream actions

## Metrics

Metrics provide quantitative measures of interaction performance:

- **Duration** — How long the interaction lasted (in milliseconds)
- **Escalations** — Whether and when escalation occurred
- **Outcomes** — Success, failure, or other outcomes
- **Tool usage** — Which tools were called and how often
- **Skill usage** — Which skills were loaded
- **Tag distribution** — Which tags were applied
- **User satisfaction** — Feedback and ratings
- **Token usage** — LLM token consumption (input and output tokens)
- **QA Score** — Quality assurance score
- **Active interactions** — Count of currently active interactions
- **Total interactions** — Count of all interactions in a time window
- **Forward amount** — Number of escalations/forwards
- **Forward percentage** — Percentage of interactions that were escalated
- **Tool failures** — Count of tool execution failures
- **Tool application failures** — Count of tool application/validation failures

### Metric Extraction

Metrics are extracted from interactions using metric extractors:

- **Time Windows** — Metrics can be calculated over different time windows (e.g., last 10 minutes, last 10 hours)
- **Filtering** — Metrics can be filtered by tenant, agent, time range, and other criteria
- **Aggregation** — Metrics are aggregated and can be used for dashboards, alerts, and analytics

### Metric Types

- **Counter Metrics** — Count occurrences (e.g., total interactions, tool failures)
- **Continuous Metrics** — Measure continuous values (e.g., duration, token usage)
- **Distribution Metrics** — Track distributions (e.g., tag distribution, sentiment distribution)

## Using Interaction Data

Interaction data enables:

- **Performance analysis** — Understand agent effectiveness
- **Pattern recognition** — Identify common issues or requests
- **Optimization** — Improve agent behavior based on data
- **Reporting** — Generate insights for stakeholders
- **Debugging** — Troubleshoot specific issues
