The email channel enables agents to interact with users through email-based conversations.

## Email Capabilities

## Email Templates

Create email templates for:

- **Follow-ups** — Subsequent responses
- **Confirmations** — Action confirmations
- **Notifications** — Alert emails

## Considerations

Email interactions have unique considerations:
- **Asynchronous** — Not real-time like chat or voice
- **Threading** — Maintain conversation context
- **Formatting** — HTML and plain text support
- **Delays** — Email delivery delays
- **Spam** — Ensure emails aren't marked as spam

## Best Practices

- **Clear subject lines** — Use descriptive subjects
- **Maintain threads** — Keep conversations organized
- **Professional tone** — Use appropriate email tone
- **Handle attachments** — Process attachments correctly
- **Test delivery** — Ensure emails are delivered

Email enables asynchronous, documented interactions through email.
