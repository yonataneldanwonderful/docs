## Agent Versioning

Agents support a versioning workflow that enables safe iteration and deployment:

**Draft → Versioned → Published**

## Version States

### Draft

Work-in-progress changes that don't affect production. Drafts allow you to:
- Experiment with changes
- Test new configurations
- Iterate without risk
- Collaborate on improvements

Drafts are not accessible to end users and don't impact production agents.

### Versioned

A snapshot of agent configuration at a point in time. Versioned agents:
- Are immutable snapshots
- Can be tested with evals
- Can be compared to other versions
- Can be rolled back to if needed

Creating a version captures the current state of the agent for testing and deployment.

### Published

The active version running in production. Published agents:
- Are live and handling real interactions
- Can be monitored and analyzed
- Can be replaced by publishing a new version
- Maintain version history for rollback

Only one version can be published at a time per agent.

## Versioning Workflow

1. **Make changes** in draft mode
2. **Test changes** with evals
3. **Create version** to snapshot the configuration
4. **Run evals** on the versioned agent
5. **Compare** performance to previous versions
6. **Publish** when ready for production
7. **Monitor** the published version
8. **Rollback** if needed to a previous version

## Evals and Versioning

Evals are tied to versions, enabling you to:
- Test specific versions before publishing
- Compare performance across versions
- Track improvements over time
- Validate changes before deployment

Each version can have its own set of evals to validate behavior.

## Version Comparison

Compare versions to understand:
- Configuration differences
- Performance metrics
- Eval results
- Tag application patterns
- Tool usage statistics

Version comparison helps you make informed decisions about deployment.

## Rollback

If a published version has issues, you can rollback to a previous version:
- Select a previous versioned state
- Publish it to replace the current version
- Restore previous behavior immediately

Rollback ensures you can quickly recover from deployment issues.

## Best Practices

- Always test versions with evals before publishing
- Keep version history for important changes
- Document changes in version notes
- Monitor published versions closely
- Have a rollback plan ready

Versioning ensures you can iterate safely and maintain production stability.
