## Agent Settings Overview

Agent settings configure how agents behave across different channels and scenarios. These settings control everything from initial greetings to voice configuration to privacy controls.

## Channels

Configure which channels the agent is available on and how it behaves on each:

- **Voice** — Phone numbers, SIP configuration, call routing
- **Chat** — Web widget configuration, embed settings
- **Email** — Inbox configuration, email handling
- **WhatsApp** — WhatsApp Business API setup
- **Embed** — Embed widget customization

Each channel can have its own configuration while sharing the same agent logic.

## Voice

Voice-specific settings control how the agent sounds and behaves in voice interactions:

- **Voice selection** — Choose from available voices
- **Speed** — Control speech rate
- **Style** — Adjust speaking style and tone
- **Language** — Set primary language
- **Barge-in** — Configure interruption handling
- **Timeout settings** — Set silence detection thresholds

## PII Reduction

Privacy controls for sensitive data:

- **Data masking** — Automatically mask PII in logs and transcripts
- **Retention policies** — Control how long data is stored
- **Access controls** — Restrict who can view sensitive information
- **Compliance settings** — Configure GDPR, HIPAA, and other compliance requirements

## Initial Message

Set custom greetings for each channel:

- **Voice greeting** — What the agent says when answering a call
- **Chat greeting** — Initial message in chat widget
- **Email template** — First email response template
- **WhatsApp greeting** — Initial WhatsApp message

Initial messages can be static or dynamic, using variables for personalization.

## Timeout & Retry Behavior

Configure how the agent handles delays and failures:

- **Response timeout** — How long to wait for user response
- **Tool timeout** — Maximum time for tool execution
- **Retry logic** — When and how to retry failed operations
- **Fallback behavior** — What to do when timeouts occur

## Channel Setup

Configure entry points for each channel:

- **Phone numbers** — Assign phone numbers for voice
- **Inboxes** — Configure email inboxes
- **Embed widgets** — Set up embed code and customization
- **Webhook endpoints** — Configure webhook URLs for integrations
