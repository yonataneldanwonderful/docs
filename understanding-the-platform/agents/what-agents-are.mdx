## What an Agent Is

An agent is a complete AI entity that can converse, call tools, load skills, and run across channels. Each agent is customized for a specific purpose and defines how the AI thinks and behaves.

Agents are the primary building blocks of Wonderful. They orchestrate conversations, make decisions, and coordinate the use of skills and tools to accomplish tasks.

## Agent Capabilities

Agents can:
- **Converse** with users through natural dialogue across multiple channels
- **Call tools** to perform actions and interact with external systems
- **Load skills** dynamically based on conversation context (in multi-skill mode) or have all skills available simultaneously (default mode)
- **Run across channels** with the same logic (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp)
- **Track events** and apply tags for analytics and routing
- **Version and publish** safely with comprehensive testing
- **Operate in different modes**: Active mode for real-time conversations or Passive mode for analysis and processing
- **Handle timeouts and escalations** with configurable behavior
- **Apply governance and automated issue detection** when enabled

## Agent Examples

Agents can be built for various purposes:

- **Customer Support** — Handle support requests, escalate issues, create tickets
- **Appointment Scheduling** — Book appointments, manage calendars, send confirmations
- **Account Management** — Update addresses, cancel cards, manage subscriptions
- **Lead Capture** — Qualify leads, collect information, route to sales
- **Technical Diagnosis** — Troubleshoot issues, provide solutions, document problems

## Agent Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — Define agent prompt, tools, and initial skills
2. **Configuration** — Set up channels, voice settings, initial messages, LLM configuration, and behavior settings
3. **Testing** — Run evals to validate behavior
4. **Versioning** — Create versions for safe iteration
5. **Publishing** — Deploy to production
6. **Monitoring** — Track performance, tags, and metrics
7. **Iteration** — Improve based on feedback and analytics

## Agent Modes

Agents can operate in two distinct modes:

### Active Mode (Default)
- **Real-time conversations** with users
- Handles live interactions across all channels
- Processes user input and generates responses immediately
- Used for customer-facing interactions

### Passive Mode
- **Analysis and processing** of existing data
- No real-time user interaction
- Useful for batch processing, analysis, and background tasks
- Can process transcripts, analyze interactions, or perform automated tasks

## Key Configuration Options

Agents support extensive configuration:

- **Multi-Skill Mode** (`IsMultiSkill`): Enable dynamic skill loading where only one skill is active at a time, or use default mode where all skills are loaded simultaneously
- **LLM Configuration**: Customize language model, provider, temperature, and other model parameters
- **Voice Configuration**: Text-to-speech settings including voice selection, speed, and style
- **Transcriber Configuration**: Speech-to-text settings for voice interactions
- **PII Configuration**: Privacy controls for masking sensitive data in text and voice
- **End-of-Turn Configuration**: Control how agents handle conversation turns
- **Timeout Settings**: Configure idle detection, hang-up behavior, and timeout messages
- **Governance**: Enable guardrails and automated issue detection
- **Automated Issues**: Enable automatic detection and flagging of conversation issues
