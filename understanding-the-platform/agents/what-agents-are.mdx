# What Agents Are

Agents are the core AI entities in Wonderful. Each agent is a configured, multi-channel AI that can converse with users, load skills, call tools, and apply governance rules for a specific business purpose.

## Overview / Why it matters

An agent defines how the AI should behave: its goals, tone, allowed tools, skills, channels, and guardrails. In the codebase this is represented by the `Agent` model, which embeds `TenantBase` for multi-tenancy and stores configuration such as voice, LLM, PII, end-of-turn behavior, and settings.

Agents orchestrate conversations across channels, decide which skills and tools to use, and produce the events and tags that power monitoring, analytics, and governance.

## How It Works

At runtime:

1. A user interaction starts on a channel (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp, embed) and is assigned to a specific agent.
2. The agent’s configuration (prompt, skills, tools, voice, LLM, PII, end-of-turn) is loaded from the `Agent` model.
3. If `IsMultiSkill` is `false`, all attached skills are available from the start. If `IsMultiSkill` is `true`, the runtime activates one skill at a time based on context.
4. The agent uses the LLM configuration to reason about the current turn and decide whether to answer directly or call tools.
5. Tools execute deterministic work and return structured responses; events and tags are recorded on the interaction.
6. Timeouts, idle checks, and forwarding behavior follow the timeout and idle configuration fields on the agent (for example `OverrideIdleCheckInterval`, `TimeoutAfterDurationSeconds`, and forwarding targets).
7. Governance and automated issues are enforced based on flags like `GovernanceEnabled` and `AutomatedIssuesEnabled`.

Agents can run in **Active** mode (real-time conversations) or **Passive** mode (background analysis and processing) via the `Mode` field.

## Key ideas at a glance

- **Identity & Description**  
  `Name`, `DisplayName`, and `Description` define how the agent is identified in the UI and logs.

- **Channel & Greeting Configuration**  
  `ChannelInitialMessages` and related helpers (`GetChannelInitialMessages`) define initial messages for voice, chat, and email by locale and gender.

- **Voice, LLM, Transcriber, and End-of-Turn**  
  `VoiceConfiguration`, `AgentLLMConfiguration`, `AgentTranscriberConfiguration`, and `AgentEndOfTurnConfiguration` control synthesis, recognition, model provider, and turn-taking behavior.

- **Skills & Tools**  
  The `Skills` relationship (`many2many:agents_skills`) connects agents to skills, which in turn own tools. `IsMultiSkill` controls whether skills are loaded all at once or one at a time.

- **Timeouts & Idle Behavior**  
  Fields like `OverrideIdleCheckInterval`, `OverrideIdleHangUpCheck`, `TimeoutAfterDurationSeconds`, and `TimeoutEndMessage` define when conversations should be checked for idleness or ended.

- **Governance & Issues**  
  Flags like `AutomatedIssuesEnabled` and `GovernanceEnabled` turn on automated issue detection and governance flows.

- **PII & Translation**  
  `AgentPIIConfiguration`, `UsePIITextMasking`, `UsePIIVoiceMasking`, `EnableTranscriptionTranslation`, and `TranslationLanguage` configure privacy and language behavior.

- **Settings & Attachments**  
  `AgentSettings` (including high-traffic forwarding and SIP header settings) and `AttachmentsConfig` control additional runtime behavior.

## Usage

1. **Design the agent**: Define the use case, channels, and KPIs. Decide which skills and tools are in scope.
2. **Create the agent**: Set `Name`, `DisplayName`, locale, voice, LLM configuration, and end-of-turn rules.
3. **Attach skills**: Link skills via the agents–skills many-to-many relationship and decide whether to enable multi-skill mode.
4. **Configure tools**: Ensure each skill has the right tools with parameters and triggers; exclude unsafe tools via `ExcludedTools` if needed.
5. **Wire channels**: Attach phone numbers, chat widgets, email addresses, or WhatsApp senders, using the telephony and channel configuration docs.
6. **Enable governance**: Turn on automated issues, tagging, and evals before publishing.
7. **Version, test, and publish**: Use evals and monitoring to validate behavior before and after publishing changes.

## FAQ's

- **What’s the difference between an agent and a skill?**  
  An agent owns the overall behavior and channels; skills are focused capabilities that can be shared across agents and loaded dynamically.

- **When should I use multi-skill mode?**  
  Use `IsMultiSkill = true` when an agent has many distinct skills (for example, support + sales + billing) and you want tighter control over which tools are active at each point in the conversation.

- **How do I support multiple languages?**  
  Configure `Locale`, `VoiceConfiguration`, and optional translation settings (`EnableTranscriptionTranslation`, `TranslationLanguage`) on the agent, and localize initial messages via `ChannelInitialMessages`.
