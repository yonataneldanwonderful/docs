## What an Agent Is

An agent is a complete AI entity that can converse, call tools, load skills, and run across channels. Each agent is customized for a specific purpose and defines how the AI thinks and behaves.

Agents are the primary building blocks of Wonderful. They orchestrate conversations, make decisions, and coordinate the use of skills and tools to accomplish tasks.

## Agent Capabilities

Agents can:
- **Converse** with users through natural dialogue across multiple channels
- **Call tools** to perform actions and interact with external systems
- **Load skills** dynamically based on conversation context
- **Run across channels** with the same logic (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp)
- **Track events** and apply tags for analytics and routing
- **Version and publish** safely with comprehensive testing

## Agent Examples

Agents can be built for various purposes:

- **Customer Support** — Handle support requests, escalate issues, create tickets
- **Appointment Scheduling** — Book appointments, manage calendars, send confirmations
- **Account Management** — Update addresses, cancel cards, manage subscriptions
- **Lead Capture** — Qualify leads, collect information, route to sales
- **Technical Diagnosis** — Troubleshoot issues, provide solutions, document problems

4. **Versioning** — Create versions for safe iteration
