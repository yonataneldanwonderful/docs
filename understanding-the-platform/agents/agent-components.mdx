## Agent Components Overview

Agents are composed of several key components that work together to define behavior and capabilities.

## System Prompt

The system prompt is a hidden scaffold that defines the core operating rules. It establishes the fundamental behavior and constraints that govern all agent interactions.

The system prompt is not user-configurable and ensures consistent, safe behavior across all agents on the platform.

## System Tools

System tools are internal tools used for engine-level behavior. Examples include:
- `skip_turn` — Skip the current turn in conversation
- `escalate` — Escalate to human agent

These tools enable the agent to manage conversation flow and handle edge cases at the engine level.

## Agent Prompt

The agent prompt defines the persona, goals, and constraints specific to this agent. It shapes:
- How the agent presents itself
- What the agent prioritizes in conversations
- The tone and style of responses
- Behavioral boundaries and constraints

The agent prompt is where you define the agent's personality and purpose.

## Agent Tools

Agent tools are always-available tools that the agent can call regardless of which skills are loaded. These typically include:
- CRM APIs for customer data
- Payment processors for transactions
- RPA actions for automation
- Core integrations essential to the agent's purpose

Agent tools are available throughout the conversation, providing persistent capabilities.

## Skills

Skills are domain-specific modules loaded only when needed. They provide focused capabilities for specific scenarios. Skills can be dynamically loaded based on:
- Conversation context
- Deterministic rules
- Tool usage requirements

Skills enable agents to stay focused and efficient by only loading what's needed.

## Skill Tools

Skill tools become available when a specific skill is active. These tools are:
- Scoped to the skill's domain
- Only accessible when that skill is loaded
- Automatically unloaded when the skill is unloaded

Skill tools provide capabilities that are specific to a skill's purpose.
