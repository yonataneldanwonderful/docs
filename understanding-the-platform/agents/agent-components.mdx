## Agent Components Overview

Agents are composed of several key components that work together to define behavior and capabilities.

## System Prompt

The system prompt is a hidden scaffold that defines the core operating rules. It establishes the fundamental behavior and constraints that govern all agent interactions.

The system prompt is not user-configurable and ensures consistent, safe behavior across all agents on the platform.

## System Tools

System tools are internal tools used for engine-level behavior. Examples include:
- `skip_turn` — Skip the current turn in conversation
- `escalate` — Escalate to human agent

These tools enable the agent to manage conversation flow and handle edge cases at the engine level.

## Agent Prompt

The agent prompt defines the persona, goals, and constraints specific to this agent. It shapes:
- How the agent presents itself
- What the agent prioritizes in conversations
- The tone and style of responses
- Behavioral boundaries and constraints

The agent prompt is where you define the agent's personality and purpose.

## Agent Tools

Agent tools are always-available tools that the agent can call regardless of which skills are loaded. These typically include:
- CRM APIs for customer data
- Payment processors for transactions
- RPA actions for automation
- Core integrations essential to the agent's purpose

Agent tools are available throughout the conversation, providing persistent capabilities.

**Tool Availability**: Tools can be configured with `AvailableIn` settings to restrict which channels they're available on (voice, chat, email). Tools can also be excluded from specific agents using the `ExcludedTools` configuration.

## Skills

Skills are domain-specific modules loaded only when needed. They provide focused capabilities for specific scenarios. Skills can be dynamically loaded based on:
- Conversation context
- Deterministic rules
- Tool usage requirements

Skills enable agents to stay focused and efficient by only loading what's needed.

## Skill Tools

Skill tools become available when a specific skill is active. These tools are:
- Scoped to the skill's domain
- Only accessible when that skill is loaded (in multi-skill mode) or always available (in default mode)
- Automatically unloaded when the skill is unloaded (multi-skill mode only)

Skill tools provide capabilities that are specific to a skill's purpose.

## Additional Agent Components

### LLM Configuration
Controls the language model and provider settings:
- Model selection and provider
- Temperature and other generation parameters
- Token limits and context window management

### Voice Configuration
Text-to-speech settings for voice interactions:
- Voice selection (gender, locale)
- Speech rate and style
- Language and accent settings

### Transcriber Configuration
Speech-to-text settings:
- Transcription provider selection
- Language detection
- Custom dictionaries (e.g., AWS Transcribe dictionaries)
- Transcription correction settings

### PII Configuration
Privacy and data protection settings:
- Text masking for PII in transcripts
- Voice masking for PII in recordings
- Masking rules and patterns

### End-of-Turn Configuration
Controls how agents handle conversation turns:
- Turn completion detection
- Response generation timing
- Turn transition behavior

### Initial Messages
Channel-specific greeting messages:
- Voice channel initial message
- Chat channel initial message
- Email channel initial message
- Can be customized per channel or use default templates

### Settings
Additional agent behavior settings:
- Multi-skill mode toggle
- Prompt builder enablement
- Automated issues detection
- Timeout configurations
- Idle check intervals
