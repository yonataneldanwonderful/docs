## Dynamic Loading

Agents load skills only when needed. This on-demand loading keeps conversations efficient and context-focused.

## When Skills Load

Skills are activated when:

- **Agent prediction** — The agent predicts a skill is needed based on conversation context
- **Deterministic rule** — A rule triggers skill loading based on events or conditions
- **Tool requirement** — A tool usage requires a specific skill to be active

## Benefits of Dynamic Loading

Dynamic loading provides several advantages:

- **Small context** — Only relevant skills are loaded, reducing token usage
- **High accuracy** — Focused context improves agent precision
- **Cost efficiency** — Fewer tokens mean lower costs
- **Better performance** — Smaller context windows process faster
- **Focused behavior** — Agents stay on task without distraction

## Loading Process

1. **Detection** — Agent or system detects need for a skill
2. **Loading** — Skill is loaded into agent context
3. **Activation** — Skill tools become available
4. **Execution** — Skill handles the relevant task
5. **Unloading** — Skill is unloaded when no longer needed

## Unloading Skills

Skills are automatically unloaded when:
- The task is complete
- The conversation moves to a different topic
- A deterministic rule triggers unloading
- The interaction ends

Unloading keeps the context clean and focused.
