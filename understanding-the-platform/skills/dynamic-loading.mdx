## Dynamic Loading

Agents load skills only when needed. This on-demand loading keeps conversations efficient and context-focused.

## When Skills Load

Skills are activated when:

- **Agent prediction** — The agent predicts a skill is needed based on conversation context
- **Deterministic rule** — A rule triggers skill loading based on events or conditions
- **Tool requirement** — A tool usage requires a specific skill to be active

## Benefits of Dynamic Loading

Dynamic loading provides several advantages:

- **Small context** — Only relevant skills are loaded, reducing token usage
- **High accuracy** — Focused context improves agent precision
- **Cost efficiency** — Fewer tokens mean lower costs
- **Better performance** — Smaller context windows process faster
- **Focused behavior** — Agents stay on task without distraction

## Loading Process

1. **Detection** — Agent or system detects need for a skill
2. **Loading** — Skill is loaded into agent context
3. **Activation** — Skill tools become available
4. **Execution** — Skill handles the relevant task
5. **Unloading** — Skill is unloaded when no longer needed

## Unloading Skills

Skills are automatically unloaded when:
- The task is complete
- The conversation moves to a different topic
- A deterministic rule triggers unloading
- The interaction ends

Unloading keeps the context clean and focused.

## Skill Registry and Toolkit Caching

In multi-skill mode, the platform uses a skill registry system:

- **Skill Registry**: All attached skills are registered at conversation start
- **Toolkit Caching**: Toolkits for each skill are built on-demand and cached for performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Toolkits are only built when a skill is first activated
- **Atomic Operations**: Toolkit building is atomic to ensure consistency

This architecture ensures efficient skill switching with minimal overhead.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Default Mode
- You have 1-3 skills
- Tools from different skills are frequently used together
- You want the simplest configuration
- All skills are relevant to most conversations

### When to Use Multi-Skill Mode
- You have 4+ skills
- Skills represent distinct domains or workflows
- You want the LLM to focus on one domain at a time
- Skills have overlapping or conflicting tool names
- You want better control over which tools are available when

### Skill Design Tips
- **Keep skills focused**: Each skill should handle one specific domain
- **Design for reusability**: Create skills that can be shared across agents
- **Use clear naming**: Name skills after the action they perform
- **Avoid monolithic skills**: Split large skills into smaller, focused ones
- **Consider tool scoping**: Use skill tools for domain-specific actions
