## What Skills Are

Skills are self-contained sub-agents that encode a specific capability. Examples include "Cancel Credit Card" or "Create Support Ticket". Each skill is a focused module that handles a particular domain or task.

## Why Skills Exist

Skills provide several key benefits:

- **Keep context small** — Only load what's needed, reducing token usage and improving accuracy
- **Focus behavior** — Narrow scope enables more precise responses
- **Enable reusability** — Share skills across multiple agents
- **Control deterministic tagging** — Skills can trigger specific tags and behaviors
- **Scope tools safely** — Tools are only available when the relevant skill is active

## Skill Characteristics

Skills are:
- **Self-contained** — Include their own prompts and tools
- **Focused** — Handle a specific domain or task
- **Reusable** — Can be shared across multiple agents
- **Dynamic** — Load only when needed
- **Composable** — Can work together with other skills

## Skill Examples

Common skill examples:
- **Cancel Credit Card** — Handles card cancellation requests
- **Create Support Ticket** — Creates tickets in support systems
- **Schedule Appointment** — Books appointments and manages calendars
- **Update Address** — Updates customer address information
- **Check Order Status** — Retrieves and reports order information
