## What Skills Are

Skills are self-contained sub-agents that encode a specific capability. Examples include "Cancel Credit Card" or "Create Support Ticket". Each skill is a focused module that handles a particular domain or task.

## Why Skills Exist

Skills provide several key benefits:

- **Keep context small** — Only load what's needed, reducing token usage and improving accuracy
- **Focus behavior** — Narrow scope enables more precise responses
- **Enable reusability** — Share skills across multiple agents
- **Control deterministic tagging** — Skills can trigger specific tags and behaviors
- **Scope tools safely** — Tools are only available when the relevant skill is active

## Skill Characteristics

Skills are:
- **Self-contained** — Include their own prompts (instructions) and tools
- **Focused** — Handle a specific domain or task
- **Reusable** — Can be shared across multiple agents via many-to-many relationship
- **Dynamic** — Load only when needed (in multi-skill mode) or always available (default mode)
- **Composable** — Can work together with other skills
- **Tag-enabled** — Can have associated tags for analytics and routing
- **Active/Inactive** — Can be enabled or disabled without deletion

## Skill Examples

Common skill examples:
- **Cancel Credit Card** — Handles card cancellation requests
- **Create Support Ticket** — Creates tickets in support systems
- **Schedule Appointment** — Books appointments and manages calendars
- **Update Address** — Updates customer address information
- **Check Order Status** — Retrieves and reports order information

## Skill Structure

Each skill contains:
- **Name and Display Name** — Identifier and human-readable name
- **Description** — What the skill does
- **Instructions** — Prompt/instructions that define the skill's behavior
- **Tools** — Collection of tools scoped to this skill
- **Tags** — Associated tags for tracking and analytics
- **Active Status** — Whether the skill is currently enabled

## Skill Loading Modes

Skills can be used in two modes:

### Default Mode (Always-Loaded)
- All skills attached to an agent are loaded at conversation start
- All tools from all skills are immediately available
- No skill switching required
- Best for agents with few skills (1-3) or when tools are frequently used together

### Multi-Skill Mode (Dynamic Loading)
- Skills are registered but only one is active at a time
- Tools from only the active skill are available
- Agent can switch between skills during conversation
- Best for agents with many skills (4+) or distinct domains

See [Dynamic Loading](/understanding-the-platform/skills/dynamic-loading) for detailed information.
