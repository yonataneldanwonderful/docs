## Base Skills

Base skills are optional always-loaded skills for scenarios where a capability must always be available.

## When to Use Base Skills

Base skills are appropriate when:

- **Always-available capability** — A capability must never require dynamic loading
- **Foundational behavior** — A foundational behavior layer is needed
- **Critical tools** — Tools that must never be unavailable
- **Core functionality** — Essential functions that every conversation needs

## Base Skills vs Dynamic Skills

**Base Skills:**
- Always loaded
- Always available
- Persistent in context
- Use when capability must never be unavailable

**Dynamic Skills:**
- Load on demand
- Available when needed
- Removed when done
- Use for focused, task-specific capabilities

## Examples

Common base skill examples:
- **Greeting** — Always-available greeting and introduction
- **Escalation** — Always-available escalation capability
- **Help** — Always-available help and guidance
- **Basic Navigation** — Core navigation and routing

## Best Practices

- Use base skills sparingly — Only for truly essential capabilities
- Keep base skills minimal — Small, focused base skills maintain efficiency
- Prefer dynamic loading — Use dynamic skills when possible
- Monitor context size — Ensure base skills don't bloat context unnecessarily

Base skills provide a persistent layer of functionality that's always accessible, regardless of which other skills are dynamically loaded.
