## Skill Prompts

The skill prompt defines the skill's specific behavior, constraints, and goals. It guides how the skill interprets context and responds to user requests.

### Prompt Components

Skill prompts typically include:
- **Purpose** — What the skill does
- **Scope** — What the skill handles
- **Constraints** — What the skill doesn't do
- **Behavior** — How the skill should act
- **Output format** — How the skill should respond

### Prompt Best Practices

- **Be specific** — Clearly define the skill's purpose and scope
- **Set boundaries** — Explicitly state what the skill doesn't handle
- **Provide examples** — Include example interactions
- **Define success** — Specify what successful completion looks like

## Skill Tools

Skill tools are capabilities that become available only when the skill is active. These tools are:
- **Scoped to the skill** — Only available when skill is loaded
- **Domain-specific** — Provide actions needed for the skill's purpose
- **Automatically managed** — Loaded and unloaded with the skill

### Tool Types in Skills

Skills can include:
- **API integrations** — Connect to external systems
- **Data operations** — Read, write, or update data
- **Notifications** — Send alerts or messages
- **Workflow actions** — Trigger downstream processes

## Skill Components Together

Skill prompts and tools work together:
- **Prompt defines behavior** — How the skill thinks and responds
- **Tools provide capabilities** — What the skill can do
- **Together they create** — A complete, focused capability

## Deterministic Tag Rules

Skills can trigger deterministic tags based on:
- **Skill activation** — Tag when skill loads
- **Tool execution** — Tag when tools are called
- **Completion** — Tag when skill completes
- **Errors** — Tag when skill encounters issues

Deterministic tag rules (future V2) will allow skills to automatically apply tags based on their activation or specific events within the skill's execution.
