## Tool Import/Export

Import and export tools to share them across environments, teams, or organizations.

## Exporting Tools

Export tools to:
- **Share with teams** — Distribute tools to other teams
- **Backup configurations** — Save tool configurations
- **Version control** — Track tool changes
- **Environment migration** — Move tools between environments

## Importing Tools

Import tools to:
- **Reuse existing tools** — Use tools created elsewhere
- **Restore backups** — Restore from saved configurations
- **Standardize** — Use organization-standard tools
- **Onboard** — Quickly set up new environments

## Export Format

Tools are exported as structured data including:
- Tool configuration
- Authentication settings
- Parameter schemas
- Metadata and descriptions

## Import Process

1. **Select file** — Choose exported tool file
2. **Review configuration** — Check tool settings
3. **Configure auth** — Set up authentication for new environment
4. **Test** — Verify tool works in new environment
5. **Deploy** — Make tool available

## Best Practices

- **Document tools** — Include clear descriptions
- **Version exports** — Track different versions
- **Test imports** — Verify tools work after import
- **Secure credentials** — Don't export sensitive credentials
- **Organize exports** — Keep exports organized and labeled

Import/export enables tool reuse and standardization across your organization.
