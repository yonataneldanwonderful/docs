## Tool Types

Tools come in different types, each serving a specific purpose and scope.

## System Tools

System tools provide engine-level behavior. These are internal tools that manage conversation flow, handle escalations, and control core agent functionality.

Examples:
- `skip_turn` — Skip the current turn in conversation
- `escalate` — Escalate to human agent

System tools are always available and handle fundamental agent operations.

## Agent Tools

Agent tools are always accessible to an agent, regardless of which skills are loaded. These typically include:
- CRM APIs for customer data
- Payment processors for transactions
- RPA actions for automation
- Core integrations essential to the agent's purpose

Agent tools provide persistent capabilities that are available throughout the conversation.

## Skill Tools

Skill tools are available only when a specific skill is active. They provide domain-specific capabilities that are scoped to the skill's functionality.

When a skill is unloaded, its tools are no longer accessible. This scoping ensures tools are only available when relevant.

## Tenant Tools

Tenant tools are shared across all agents within a tenant. They provide common capabilities that multiple agents can use, promoting:
- Consistency across agents
- Reduced duplication
- Centralized maintenance
- Shared functionality

Tenant tools enable reuse and standardization across your organization.
