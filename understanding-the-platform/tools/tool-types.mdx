## Tool Types

Tools come in different types, each serving a specific purpose and scope. Tools are associated with skills and can be triggered in different ways based on their configuration.

## System Tools

System tools provide engine-level behavior. These are internal tools that manage conversation flow, handle escalations, and control core agent functionality.

Examples:
- `skip_turn` — Skip the current turn in conversation
- `escalate` — Escalate to human agent

System tools are always available and handle fundamental agent operations.

## Agent Tools

Agent tools are always accessible to an agent, regardless of which skills are loaded. These typically include:
- CRM APIs for customer data
- Payment processors for transactions
- RPA actions for automation
- Core integrations essential to the agent's purpose

Agent tools provide persistent capabilities that are available throughout the conversation.

## Skill Tools

Skill tools are available only when a specific skill is active. They provide domain-specific capabilities that are scoped to the skill's functionality.

When a skill is unloaded (in multi-skill mode), its tools are no longer accessible. In default mode, all skill tools are always available. This scoping ensures tools are only available when relevant.

**Note**: All tools must be associated with a skill. Tools without a skill association are not supported.

## Tenant Tools

Tenant tools are shared across all agents within a tenant. They provide common capabilities that multiple agents can use, promoting:
- Consistency across agents
- Reduced duplication
- Centralized maintenance
- Shared functionality

Tenant tools enable reuse and standardization across your organization.

## Choosing Tool Types

**Use System Tools for:**
- Core engine functionality
- Fundamental operations
- Platform-level behavior

**Use Agent Tools for:**
- Core agent capabilities
- Always-needed integrations
- Persistent functionality

**Use Skill Tools for:**
- Domain-specific actions
- Task-specific capabilities
- Scoped functionality

**Use Tenant Tools for:**
- Shared capabilities
- Common integrations
- Organization-wide functionality

## Tool Function Types

Beyond scope (system, agent, skill, tenant), tools also have function types that define how they execute:

### API Tools (`FuncTypeAPI`)
- Connect to external REST APIs
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Support authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
- Transform request/response data

### RAG Tools (`FuncTypeRAG`)
- Query knowledge bases and document stores
- Perform semantic search
- Retrieve context from uploaded documents
- Support retrieval-augmented generation

### Programmable Tools (`FuncTypeProgrammable`)
- Execute custom JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Handle complex business logic
- Perform data transformations
- Integrate with custom workflows

### Mock Tools (`FuncTypeMock`)
- Testing and development tools
- Simulate API responses
- Prototype without external dependencies

## Tool Triggers

Tools can be triggered in different ways based on their `Trigger` configuration:

- **`agent`** (default) — Called by the agent during conversation based on context
- **`on_start`** — Executed automatically when interaction starts
- **`on_end`** — Executed automatically when interaction ends
- **`on_enhanced_finished`** — Executed after enhancement/processing completes
- **`on_user_transcription`** — Triggered when user transcription is received
- **`on_agent_transcription`** — Triggered when agent transcription is generated
- **`on_before_first_message`** — Executed before the first agent message
- **`on_after_first_message`** — Executed after the first agent message
- **`on_user_finished_hearing`** — Triggered when user finishes hearing agent response
- **`on_user_interruption`** — Triggered when user interrupts the agent
- **`on_tool_call`** — Triggered when another tool is called

## Tool Configuration

Tools support extensive configuration options:

- **Available In** — Restrict which channels the tool is available on (voice, chat, email)
- **Parameters** — Define input parameters with types, descriptions, defaults, and validation
- **Non-exposed Parameters** — Parameters that are not shown to the LLM but have default values
- **Required Parameters** — Parameters that must be provided
- **Enum Values** — Predefined options for parameters
- **Function Config** — Channel-specific behavior, announcements, delays, and permissions
- **Agent Notes** — Internal notes about tool usage (not shown to LLM)
