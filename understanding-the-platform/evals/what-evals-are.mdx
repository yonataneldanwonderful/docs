## What Evals Are

Evals are structured test scenarios that measure agent behavior. They provide a systematic way to validate that agents perform correctly across different situations and use cases.

## Purpose of Evals

Evals enable you to:
- **Validate behavior** — Ensure agents work as expected
- **Test changes** — Verify improvements before deployment
- **Compare versions** — Evaluate different agent configurations
- **Track performance** — Monitor agent effectiveness over time
- **Catch regressions** — Identify when changes break functionality

## Eval Components

Evals include several key components:

- **Scenario text** — The input or situation being tested
- **Expected answers** — What the agent should say or do
- **Tool/behavior checks** — Validation that correct tools were called
- **Metrics** — Quantitative measures of performance
- **Output comparison** — How actual behavior compares to expected behavior

## Eval Types

### Single Scenario

Test one specific interaction pattern to validate agent handles a particular case correctly.

### Batch

Run multiple scenarios with iterations to test agent behavior across a range of cases.

### Voice

Test voice channel interactions, accounting for timing, latency, and audio quality.

### Human Feedback

Incorporate human judgment to improve agent behavior.

## Eval Lifecycle

1. **Create** — Define test scenarios
2. **Run** — Execute evals against agents
3. **Analyze** — Review results and metrics
4. **Iterate** — Improve agents based on results
5. **Compare** — Evaluate different versions

Evals are essential for building reliable, production-ready agents.
