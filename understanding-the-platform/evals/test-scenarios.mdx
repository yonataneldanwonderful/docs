## Test Scenarios

Test scenarios define specific situations to test agent behavior. They form the foundation of evals.

## Scenario Components

Scenarios include:
- **Input** — What the user says or does
- **Context** — Background information or conversation history
- **Expected output** — What the agent should say or do
- **Tool checks** — Which tools should be called
- **Tag checks** — Which tags should be applied
- **Success criteria** — How to determine if the scenario passed

## Creating Scenarios

When creating scenarios:
- **Be specific** — Clearly define the situation
- **Set expectations** — Specify expected behavior
- **Include context** — Provide necessary background
- **Test edge cases** — Include boundary conditions
- **Cover variations** — Test different phrasings

## Scenario Types

### Happy Path

Test the ideal flow where everything works correctly.

### Edge Cases

Test boundary conditions and unusual situations.

### Error Handling

Test how agents handle errors and failures.

### Multi-Turn

Test extended conversations with multiple exchanges.

## Best Practices

- **Start simple** — Begin with basic scenarios
- **Build complexity** — Add more complex scenarios over time
- **Document clearly** — Explain what each scenario tests
- **Keep organized** — Group related scenarios
- **Update regularly** — Keep scenarios current with agent changes

Test scenarios are the building blocks of effective evals.
