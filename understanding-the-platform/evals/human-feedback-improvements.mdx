## Human Feedback

Human feedback evals incorporate human judgment to improve agent behavior. They allow reviewers to assess agent responses and provide guidance for refinement.

## How Human Feedback Works

1. **Agent responds** — Agent generates a response
2. **Human reviews** — Human reviewer evaluates the response
3. **Feedback provided** — Reviewer provides feedback and ratings
4. **Improvements made** — Agent is improved based on feedback
5. **Re-evaluation** — Agent is tested again

## Feedback Types

Human feedback can include:
- **Quality ratings** — Rate response quality
- **Correctness** — Assess if response is correct
- **Helpfulness** — Evaluate how helpful the response is
- **Tone assessment** — Review tone and style
- **Improvement suggestions** — Provide specific improvements

## Using Feedback

Use human feedback to:
- **Improve prompts** — Refine agent and skill prompts
- **Adjust behavior** — Modify agent behavior
- **Fix issues** — Address specific problems
- **Enhance quality** — Improve response quality
- **Validate changes** — Confirm improvements work

## Feedback Loop

The feedback loop:
1. **Collect feedback** — Gather human evaluations
2. **Analyze patterns** — Identify common issues
3. **Make changes** — Update agent configuration
4. **Test improvements** — Validate changes work
5. **Iterate** — Continue improving

## Best Practices

- **Regular reviews** — Schedule regular feedback sessions
- **Diverse reviewers** — Get feedback from multiple people
- **Specific feedback** — Ask for specific, actionable feedback
- **Track improvements** — Monitor improvement over time
- **Validate changes** — Test improvements before deploying

Human feedback is essential for creating high-quality, production-ready agents.
