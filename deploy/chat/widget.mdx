# Chat widget

The Wonderful chat widget is an embeddable web component that connects users on your site to a specific agent over the chat channel.

## Overview

The widget is delivered as a JavaScript snippet that:

- Loads `wonderful-chat.js` from your Wonderful environment.  
- Instantiates `window.WonderfulChat` with your `agentId` and configuration.  
- Opens a WebSocket connection to the agent’s chat endpoint.

Use this page when you want to embed a production-ready chat experience into your website or web app.

<Info>
  The chat widget connects directly to a **single agent** via `agentId`. Create separate snippets or configurations if you need different agents on different properties.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Embed script**  
   - A script tag loads `wonderful-chat.js` from your Wonderful deployment (`/embed/wonderful-chat.js`).  
   - Once loaded, it creates a new `WonderfulChat` instance with the configuration you provide.
2. **Configuration object**  
   - Core fields include:
     - `environment`: API host (for example `api.wonderful.ai`).  
     - `agentId`: the ID of the agent to connect to.  
     - `agentName`, `buttonText`, `placeholderText`, `isRTL`.  
     - Theme colors and appearance options.
3. **Connection lifecycle**  
   - The widget opens a WebSocket to `embedded/agents/{agentId}/chat`.  
   - It sends and receives messages, updates UI state, and handles retries when the connection drops.
4. **UI behavior**  
   - The widget renders a floating button and chat window, handles open/close animations, and displays messages for the user and agent.

## Components

- **wonderful-chat.js**  
  - The front-end implementation of the widget, including defaults and UI behavior.

- **Embed configuration**  
  - Options such as environment, agent metadata, and theme colors.

- **WebSocket connection**  
  - Real-time connection to the agent chat endpoint under `/embedded/agents/{id}/chat`.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Copy the embed snippet">
  From the UI (for example the embed code generator), copy the JavaScript snippet that loads `wonderful-chat.js` and initializes `WonderfulChat` with your agent ID and theme.
</Step>

<Step title="Paste into your site">
  Add the snippet near the end of your HTML `<body>` on the pages where you want chat available.
</Step>

<Step title="Customize appearance">
  Adjust colors, text, and RTL/LTR settings in the configuration to match your brand.
</Step>

<Step title="Test the widget">
  Load your site, open the widget, and verify that conversations are created and linked to the correct agent.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

- **Which agent does the widget connect to?**  
  The widget always connects to the agent whose `agentId` you pass into `WonderfulChat`.

- **Can I run multiple widgets on one site?**  
  Yes, by instantiating multiple `WonderfulChat` instances with different agent IDs or configurations (be mindful of UX).

- **How do I change the environment for staging vs production?**  
  Update the `environment` field in the configuration and the script URL to point to the appropriate Wonderful deployment.
