# Manage

The Manage section is where you connect built agents to real users across chat, voice, email, and messaging channels, and where you integrate with existing contact center infrastructure.

## Overview

<Info>
  Use **Manage** when you are moving from a working agent to a live deployment, or when you need to change how traffic reaches agents across channels.
</Info>

While **Build** defines what agents can do, **Manage** defines how they are exposed in production:

- **Interactions**: how conversations are created, tagged, and routed.  
- **Chat**: widget deployment and chat channel configuration.  
- **Telephony**: SIP trunks, phone numbers, call routing, and CCaaS integrations.  
- **Other channels**: email, WhatsApp, and embedded experiences, including channel-specific setup.

Use this area when you are moving from a working agent to a live deployment, or when you need to change how traffic reaches agents.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure channel entry points">
  For each channel, configure entry points (widgets, phone numbers, email inboxes, WhatsApp senders, embeds) that map to agents and tenants.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable routing & orchestration">
  Use controller and telephony/chat/email configuration to route inbound requests to the right agent, create `Communication` records, and start orchestrators.
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate with infrastructure">
  Configure telephony and CCaaS integrations (for example SIP trunks, Twilio, or contact centers) so calls can enter and leave Wonderful safely, including high-traffic forwarding and transfers.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust over time">
  As you roll out, adjust routing rules, capacity settings, and CCaaS integrations to balance agent coverage and quality.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Components

- **Interactions management**  
  - Views and settings for how interactions are stored, tagged, and surfaced.

- **Chat management**  
  - Widget configuration, embedding, and per-agent chat settings.

- **Telephony & CCaaS**  
  - SIP trunk configuration, phone number management, call routing, and CCaaS integrations.

- **Other channels**  
  - Email, WhatsApp, and embedded UIs, plus their channel-specific setup.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with a single channel">
  For first deployments, choose one channel (typically telephony or web chat) and configure it end-to-end for a single agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach additional channels">
  Once behavior is stable, add chat widgets, email, WhatsApp, or embed using the channel-specific setup guides.
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate with existing contact center">
  Use CCaaS integrations and telephony configuration to coordinate Wonderful agents with human agents.
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate on routing and capacity">
  Adjust routing, capacity thresholds, and channel availability as you learn from interactions and monitoring.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

- **Where should I start when going live?**  
  Begin with one agent and one channel, verify quality and routing, then expand to more channels and agents.

- **How do Manage and Build relate?**  
  Build defines agent behavior; Manage connects that behavior to real-world entry points and infrastructure.

- **Can I route the same channel to multiple agents?**  
  Yes, depending on your telephony/chat/email setup, but you should design clear routing rules to avoid conflicts.
