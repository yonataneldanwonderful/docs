# Telephony

Telephony configuration connects your phone numbers, carriers, and CCaaS platforms to Wonderful so voice calls can be handled by agents.

## Overview

Telephony covers:

- **Phone numbers & routing**: how inbound calls reach Wonderful.  
- **Media pipeline**: how audio is streamed to the voice orchestrator and back.  
- **Forwarding & failover**: how calls are forwarded or handed off when needed.

Use this page as the high-level guide to deploying voice agents; see subpages for SIP trunking and CCaaS integrations.

<Info>
  Start with a **single test number and agent** to validate end-to-end behavior before wiring production numbers or CCaaS flows.

## How It Works

1. **Inbound call handling**  
   - Calls arrive via SIP trunks or hosted telephony (for example Twilio) at `/telephony` endpoints.  
   - Telephony APIs parse call details, map numbers to agents, and create `CallDetails` and `Communication` records.
2. **Routing to agents**  
   - The controller uses `CallDetails` and routing configuration to resolve the right agent (and tenant) for the call.  
   - High-traffic and forwarding settings can redirect calls if concurrency limits are exceeded.
3. **Voice orchestration**  
   - The call orchestrator connects media streams to the agent’s voice and transcription configuration, running ASR/TTS and conversation logic in real time.
4. **Recording & metadata**  
   - Call recording and metadata collection are handled by telephony and recording services, using tenant and agent settings for retention and governance.

## Components

- **Telephony APIs**  
  - Endpoints under `/telephony` for carriers and providers (for example Twilio) to send webhooks and media events.

- **CallDetails & Communication**  
  - Models that represent call-level metadata and the interaction record.

- **Call orchestrator**  
  - Manages call state, media, and integration with the agent runtime.

- **Tenant telephony settings**  
  - Per-tenant configuration for call forwarding, available phone countries, and related features.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure SIP trunks or provider webhooks">
  Set up carriers or providers to send calls to Wonderful’s telephony endpoints (see **SIP trunk**).
</Step>

<Step title="Assign phone numbers">
  Map phone numbers to agents and tenants using phone number and routing configuration.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure agent voice & transcription">
  Ensure agents have appropriate voice, transcriber, and language settings for the target markets.
</Step>

<Step title="Set forwarding and failover policies">
  Configure high-traffic forwarding and CCaaS integration so calls can fall back to human agents when needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Test with real calls">
  Place test calls through the full path and validate routing, audio quality, and behavior.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

- **Can I mix hosted telephony and SIP trunks?**  
  Yes. You can integrate both, as long as routing to Wonderful’s `/telephony` endpoints is configured correctly.

- **How do I route calls to different agents?**  
  Use phone number and routing configuration (potentially including SIP metadata) to map numbers or services to specific agents.

- **Where do I control call recording?**  
  Recording behavior is governed by tenant and agent settings and telephony services; see monitoring and privacy docs for details.
