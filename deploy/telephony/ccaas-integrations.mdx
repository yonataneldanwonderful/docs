# CCaaS integrations

CCaaS integrations let Wonderful agents coexist with human agents on existing contact center platforms, sharing numbers, queues, and reporting.

## Overview

With CCaaS integrations you can:

- Route calls between Wonderful agents and human agents.  
- Use existing CCaaS routing, skills, and reporting while offloading suitable traffic to Wonderful.  
- Gradually roll out automation without replacing your contact center stack.

This page focuses on high-level patterns; details vary by CCaaS vendor.

## How It Works

1. **Telephony interop**  
   - Calls flow between CCaaS and Wonderful via SIP, PSTN forwarding, or provider-specific integrations (for example Twilio).  
   - Metadata such as call IDs, queue names, and customer identifiers can be passed in headers or parameters.
2. **Routing patterns**  
   - **Front-door automation**: calls first hit Wonderful; only escalations are sent to CCaaS queues.  
   - **Backstop automation**: CCaaS routes certain queues or overflow traffic to Wonderful.  
   - **Hybrid flows**: calls move between Wonderful and CCaaS based on business rules (for example hours, language, or segment).
3. **Transfers and forwarding**  
   - The call orchestrator can forward calls back to CCaaS numbers or SIP endpoints using configured forwarding logic.  
   - SIP headers and metadata are preserved where possible to maintain context.
4. **Reporting and analytics**  
   - CCaaS continues to provide queue-level reporting, while Wonderful tracks interaction-level metrics and tags; you can correlate via shared IDs.

## Components

- **Telephony integration**  
  - SIP trunks, numbers, and routing rules linking CCaaS and Wonderful.

- **Forwarding & transfer logic**  
  - Orchestrator logic that decides when and where to forward or transfer calls.

- **Metadata & identifiers**  
  - Shared identifiers (for example call IDs, queue IDs) that enable reporting across systems.

## Usage

1. **Choose an integration pattern**  
   - Decide whether Wonderful should sit in front of, behind, or alongside your CCaaS for each use case.
2. **Configure telephony paths**  
   - Set up SIP or PSTN routing so calls can move between CCaaS and Wonderful in both directions where required.
3. **Define escalation rules**  
   - Implement rules in agents and telephony configuration for when to transfer or forward calls to human agents or specific queues.
4. **Align reporting**  
   - Ensure IDs and metadata are passed between systems so you can correlate CCaaS and Wonderful metrics.

## FAQ's

- **Do I need a dedicated number per integration?**  
  Not necessarily; you can share numbers as long as routing rules are well defined and metadata is preserved.

- **Can Wonderful participate in existing call flows?**  
  Yes. Use SIP or provider-specific features to insert Wonderful at appropriate points in your existing flows.

- **How do I handle failover?**  
  Design routes so calls fall back to CCaaS if Wonderful is unavailable, and configure Wonderful forwarding for high-traffic or error conditions.
