# Retention

Retention controls how long Wonderful stores interaction data, recordings, and analytics before automatically deleting them, on a per-tenant basis.

## Overview

Retention policies help you:

- Comply with data protection regulations (for example GDPR).  
- Limit how long sensitive data is stored.  
- Control storage cost and performance for large deployments.

In the product, retention is configured through data settings that specify retention windows for different data classes (logs, transcripts, recordings, analytics).

<Info>
  Retention is **tenant-scoped**: each tenant can have its own policy for how long calls, transcripts, recordings, and analytics are kept before deletion.

## How It Works

1. **Retention configuration**  
   - Data settings include fields such as:
     - `callLogRetentionDays`  
     - `transcriptRetentionDays`  
     - `recordingRetentionDays`  
     - `analyticsRetentionDays`  
     - `autoDeleteEnabled`
2. **Data classes**  
   - Retention applies separately to:
     - Call logs and interaction metadata.  
     - Transcripts and tags.  
     - Audio recordings.  
     - Aggregated analytics and metrics.
3. **Enforcement**  
   - Background jobs enforce retention by deleting or anonymizing data that exceeds configured windows.  
   - Deletions are permanent and apply across storage layers (database, object storage, analytics stores).
4. **Permissions and access**  
   - Only users with appropriate permissions (for example data retention settings permissions) can view or change retention values.

NOTE: Implementation details for cleanup jobs and exact enforcement windows may vary by deployment. Clarification required for full job schedules and storage backends.

## Components

- **Retention settings**  
  - Per-tenant configuration of retention windows and auto-delete behavior.

- **Data classes**  
  - Separate retention periods for logs, transcripts, recordings, and analytics.

- **Cleanup workflows**  
  - Background workers and jobs that delete or anonymize aged data.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Review regulatory and business requirements">
  Work with legal, security, and operations to determine how long different data types should be retained for each tenant or environment.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure retention windows">
  In data settings, set appropriate values for call log, transcript, recording, and analytics retention, and enable automatic deletion where required.
</Step>

<Step title="Test on non-production tenants">
  Apply stricter retention to staging or test tenants first and verify that cleanup behaves as expected and does not remove needed data.
</Step>

<Step title="Roll out to production tenants">
  Apply retention settings to production tenants, document the policy, and communicate changes to stakeholders.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does retention apply to all tenants equally?">
    No. Retention is configured per tenant, so different tenants can have different retention windows and auto-delete behavior.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when data reaches its retention limit?">
    When auto-delete is enabled, data older than the configured retention window is permanently deleted by background cleanup jobs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can deleted data be recovered?">
    No. Retention-driven deletions are designed to be permanent; use backups and export workflows where additional safeguards are required.
