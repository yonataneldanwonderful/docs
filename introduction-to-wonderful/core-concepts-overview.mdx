# Understanding the Wonderful platform

Wonderful is built around a small set of primitives that show up repeatedly in the codebase and product: agents, skills, tools, channels, interactions, tags, evals, and tenants. Understanding how these concepts fit together is the fastest way to reason about the platform.

## Overview

At runtime, every customer interaction is an **interaction** handled by an **agent**. The agent may load **skills**, call **tools**, apply **tags**, and send messages over different **channels** (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp, embed). Evals and monitoring run on top of these same primitives.

In the Go codebase this is reflected in shared models such as `Agent`, `Skill`, `Tool`, `Interaction`, `Tag`, and related configuration structs for voice, LLMs, end-of-turn, and PII. Services like the controller, runner, and processor manipulate these shared types to provide a single, consistent runtime.

## How It Works

1. **Agents** define prompts, configuration, attached skills, and which tools they can call.
2. A user interaction arrives through a **channel** (for example SIP, chat widget, email, WhatsApp).
3. The runtime creates or resumes an **interaction** object and records all turns, tool calls, and events.
4. Based on context and configuration, the agent loads **skills** (all at once or dynamically in multi-skill mode).
5. The LLM chooses and calls **tools** (API, RAG, programmable, mock) with structured parameters defined in the `Tool` and `Func` models.
6. Each turn produces **events** and **tags** (deterministic and LLM-based) that drive analytics, routing, and governance.
7. **Evals** and batch evals run the same flows in a controlled way, attached to specific agent versions.

This loop—interactions → agents → skills → tools → events/tags—is the core of Wonderful’s architecture.

## How to use this page

- **Design agents** by mapping your use case to these primitives: which skills, which tools, which channels, and which tags/evals you need.  
- **Look up models** in <code>common/models</code> and <code>wonderful-*/</code> services when you need precise behavior or configuration fields.  
- **Make behavior observable** by leaning on interactions, tags, metrics, and alerts instead of only reading free‑form LLM output.  
- **Plan governance early** around tenants, PII, issues, and monitoring so you can scale safely.

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to use all primitives in every deployment?">
    No. You can start with a single agent, a small set of skills, and one channel, then gradually add tools, tagging, and evals as you harden the use case.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where do these concepts live in the code?">
    Shared models and types live under <code>common/models</code> and <code>shared_types</code>, and service-specific logic for agents, skills, tools, and interactions lives primarily in <code>wonderful-controller</code> and <code>wonderful-runner-platform</code>.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which concept to reach for first?">
    If you are designing behavior, start with agents and skills; if you are integrating systems, start with tools; if you need analytics and governance, start with tags, evals, alerts, and interactions.
