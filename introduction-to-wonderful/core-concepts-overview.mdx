# Core Concepts Overview

Wonderful is built around a small set of primitives that show up repeatedly in the codebase and product: agents, skills, tools, channels, interactions, tags, evals, and tenants. Understanding how these concepts fit together is the fastest way to reason about the platform.

## Overview

At runtime, every customer interaction is an **interaction** handled by an **agent**. The agent may load **skills**, call **tools**, apply **tags**, and send messages over different **channels** (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp, embed). Evals and monitoring run on top of these same primitives.

In the Go codebase this is reflected in shared models such as `Agent`, `Skill`, `Tool`, `Interaction`, `Tag`, and related configuration structs for voice, LLMs, end-of-turn, and PII. Services like the controller, runner, and processor manipulate these shared types to provide a single, consistent runtime.

## How It Works

1. **Agents** define prompts, configuration, attached skills, and which tools they can call.
2. A user interaction arrives through a **channel** (for example SIP, chat widget, email, WhatsApp).
3. The runtime creates or resumes an **interaction** object and records all turns, tool calls, and events.
4. Based on context and configuration, the agent loads **skills** (all at once or dynamically in multi-skill mode).
5. The LLM chooses and calls **tools** (API, RAG, programmable, mock) with structured parameters defined in the `Tool` and `Func` models.
6. Each turn produces **events** and **tags** (deterministic and LLM-based) that drive analytics, routing, and governance.
7. **Evals** and batch evals run the same flows in a controlled way, attached to specific agent versions.

This loop—interactions → agents → skills → tools → events/tags—is the core of Wonderful’s architecture.

## Components

- **Agents**: Top-level AI entities in the `Agent` model that own configuration, skills, and behavior.
- **Skills**: Modular capabilities in the `Skill` model, with their own prompts, tools, tags, and active/inactive status.
- **Tools**: Deterministic functions described by the `Tool`, `Func`, and `Parameter` structs, used for APIs, RAG, programmable logic, and mocks.
- **Channels**: Delivery mechanisms (voice, chat, email, WhatsApp, embed) mapped to channel-specific configuration and infrastructure.
- **Interactions**: End-to-end conversations that capture transcripts, tool calls, and metrics for a single user journey.
- **Tags**: Boolean labels applied via deterministic rules or LLM analysis for analytics, routing, and governance.
- **Evals**: Scenarios and batches that exercise agents and interactions for regression testing and optimization.
- **Tenants**: Isolation boundary in all core models (`TenantBase`) used for multi-tenant security and configuration.

## Usage

- **Design agents** by first mapping requirements to these primitives: which skills, which tools, which channels, and which tags/evals are needed.
- **Read models** in `common/models` when you need precise behavior or configuration fields for agents, skills, tools, or interactions.
- **Use tags and events** to make behavior observable and debuggable instead of relying only on free-form LLM output.
- **Plan governance** (PII controls, automated issues, guardrails) around tenants, tags, evals, and monitoring dashboards.

When in doubt, start from this concept list, then drill into the detailed pages for each primitive.

## FAQ's

- **Do I have to use all primitives in every deployment?**  
  No. You can start with a single agent, a small set of skills, and one channel, then gradually add tools, tagging, and evals as you harden the use case.

- **Where do these concepts live in the code?**  
  Shared models and types live under `common/models` and `shared_types`, and service-specific logic for agents, skills, tools, and interactions lives primarily in `wonderful-controller` and `wonderful-runner-platform`.

- **How do I know which concept to reach for first?**  
  If you are designing behavior, start with agents and skills; if you are integrating systems, start with tools; if you need analytics and governance, start with tags, evals, and interactions.
