## A

**Agent** — A complete AI entity that can converse, call tools, load skills, and run across channels. Each agent is customized for a specific purpose.

**Agent Prompt** — Defines the persona, goals, and constraints specific to an agent. Shapes how the agent presents itself and what it prioritizes.

**Agent Tools** — Always-available tools that an agent can call regardless of which skills are loaded. Typically include core APIs like CRM integrations and payment processors.

## B

**Base Skills** — Optional always-loaded skills for scenarios where a capability must always be available or a tool must never require dynamic loading.

**Batch Evals** — Eval tests that run multiple scenarios with iterations to test agent behavior across a range of cases.

## C

**Channels** — How agents interact with users. Wonderful supports voice, chat, email, WhatsApp, and embed. All channels share the same agent logic.

**Chat** — Web chat and widget-based interactions with agents.

## D

**Deterministic Tags** — Tags applied based on rules that evaluate events. They provide 100% consistency, real-time application, and reliable metrics.

**Dynamic Loading** — The process by which agents load skills only when needed, based on conversation context, deterministic rules, or tool requirements.

## E

**Email** — Email-based agent interactions.

**Embed** — Embedded chat interfaces that can be integrated into websites.

**Evals** — Structured test scenarios that measure agent behavior. Include single scenarios, batch tests, voice-specific tests, and human feedback.

**Events** — System events that track all activity for deterministic behavior and tagging.

## I

**Inbound** — Interactions where the customer contacts the agent.

**Interactions** — A single conversation between an agent and a real user. Includes conversation transcripts, tool calls, skill loads, events, tags, and metrics.

## L

**LLM Tags** — Tags generated through prompt-based inference. The agent analyzes conversation context and applies tags based on its understanding.

## O

**Outbound** — Interactions where the agent contacts the customer.

## S

**Skill Prompt** — Defines a skill's specific behavior, constraints, and goals. Guides how the skill interprets context and responds to user requests.

**Skill Tools** — Tools that become available only when a specific skill is active. Scoped to the skill's domain.

**Skills** — Self-contained sub-agents that encode specific capabilities. Load dynamically based on context to keep agent context small and focused.

**System Prompt** — A hidden scaffold that defines the core operating rules. Establishes fundamental behavior and constraints that govern all agent interactions.

**System Tools** — Internal tools used for engine-level behavior. Examples include `skip_turn` and `escalate`.

## T

**Tags** — Yes/no markers applied to a conversation or turn. Used for analytics, routing, behavior tracking, and product logic.

**Tag Libraries** — Collections of reusable tags organized by domain or use case.

**Tenant Tools** — Tools shared across all agents within a tenant. Provide common capabilities that multiple agents can use.

**Tools** — APIs or internal actions the agent can call. Represent capabilities available to agents, skills, and the system.

## V

**Versioning** — The workflow for agents: Draft → Versioned → Published. Enables safe iteration, testing, and rollback.

**Voice** — Voice-based interactions via SIP, phone numbers, TTS/ASR.

**Voice Evals** — Eval tests specifically for voice channel interactions, accounting for timing, latency, barge-in behavior, and audio quality.

## W

**WhatsApp** — WhatsApp messaging-based agent interactions.
