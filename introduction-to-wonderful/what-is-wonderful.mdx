## What is Wonderful?

Wonderful is a platform for building AI agents that run across channels (voice, chat, email), powered by dynamic skills, deterministic tools, and real-time system events.

Wonderful gives teams:

- A unified agent model
- A clean way to structure intelligence (agents → skills → tools)
- Deterministic execution (events → rules → tags)
- Strong evals and versioning
- Enterprise-grade channel support

## One-Liner

Wonderful is the platform for building AI agents that work across voice, chat, email, and WhatsApp with dynamic skills and deterministic tools.

## Platform Positioning

Wonderful enables teams to build production-ready AI agents that:
- Work consistently across all communication channels
- Scale efficiently with dynamic skill loading
- Execute reliably through deterministic tool execution
- Track behavior accurately with event-driven tagging
- Deploy safely with comprehensive versioning and evals

## Key Differentiators

- **Dynamic Skills**: Only load what you need → small context, high accuracy
- **Deterministic Tools**: APIs define what the agent can do with guaranteed execution
- **Multi-Channel by Design**: Voice, chat, email all share the same agent logic
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time system events enable deterministic behavior
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built for scale, reliability, and governance
