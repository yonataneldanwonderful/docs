# Quickstart

This guide walks you through building and shipping a first Wonderful agent end‑to‑end: from definition to a live channel and basic monitoring.

<Info>
  You can follow this guide in a sandbox tenant. For production rollouts, see the Build, Manage, Monitor, and Privacy sections for deeper guidance.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- **Wonderful access**: A tenant and access to the Wonderful UI.  
- **One use case in mind**: For example, an inbound support line for common questions.  
- **At least one channel ready**: A phone number you can connect, or a web property where you can embed a chat widget.

## Step 1 – Create an agent

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Build area">
  Go to the **Build** section and create a new agent. Give it a clear name (for example <code>Inbound Support (Voice + Chat)</code>) and a short description that explains what it should do.
</Step>

<Step title="Clarify the use case and mode">
  Decide whether this is primarily a support, sales, collections, or internal assistant agent, and ensure the mode is set for real‑time interactions where appropriate.
</Step>

<Step title="Fill in basic configuration">
  Set locale, timeouts, and any required governance flags (for example automated issues, PII configuration) so the agent is safe to run in a test environment.
</Step>
</Steps>

See: [`Build → Overview`](/build-agents/overview) and [`Build → Skills`](/build-agents/skills).

## Step 2 – Add skills and tools

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify the capabilities needed">
  List the concrete things your agent must do (for example look up orders, reset passwords, check account status, create tickets).
</Step>

<Step title="Create or reuse skills">
  Create skills that group related capabilities (for example <code>Support Skill</code> for ticketing, <code>Accounts Skill</code> for account checks) or reuse existing skills if your tenant already has them.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach tools to skills">
  For each capability, attach tools to the right skills (API tools, low‑code tools, MCP tools, or RAG knowledge). Keep descriptions and parameters clear so the LLM knows when and how to call them.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach skills to the agent">
  Attach the skills to your agent and decide whether to run in single‑ or multi‑skill mode depending on how broad the agent’s responsibilities are.
</Step>
</Steps>

See: [`Build → Skills`](/build-agents/skills) and [`Build → Tools`](/build-agents/tools/agent-tools-and-skill-tools).

## Step 3 – Configure models, voice, and language

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose an LLM provider and model">
  In the agent’s model configuration, pick an LLM provider and model that match your latency, cost, and quality needs. Start with a balanced default and adjust later based on monitoring.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure voice (for voice agents)">
  Select a voice, style, speed, and language settings that fit your brand and audience. Ensure locale and transcription language are aligned.
</Step>

<Step title="Set guardrails and PII behavior">
  Configure PII redaction and any other governance rules so that prompts, logs, and recordings behave correctly for your data policies.
</Step>
</Steps>

See: [`Build → Models`](/build-agents/models) and [`Build → Voice & language`](/build-agents/voice-and-language/voices).

## Step 4 – Connect a channel

Decide whether to start with **voice** or **chat** (or both):

<Steps>
<Step title="For voice: telephony & CCaaS">
  Configure a SIP trunk or CCaaS / Twilio integration, assign a test phone number to your agent, and verify calls route into Wonderful and back out correctly.
</Step>

<Step title="For chat: widget">
  Embed the Wonderful chat widget in a test environment, configure branding, and point it at your new agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Other channels (optional)">
  If needed, configure email, WhatsApp, or embed flows once the core experience is working in your primary channel.
</Step>
</Steps>

See: [`Manage → Telephony`](/deploy/telephony/telephony) and [`Manage → Chat widget`](/deploy/chat/widget).

## Step 5 – Test, monitor, and iterate

<Steps>
<Step title="Run manual test conversations">
  Call the test number or use the chat widget and walk through real scenarios: happy path, edge cases, and failure modes. Note where behavior is confusing or incomplete.
</Step>

<Step title="Review interactions and tags">
  In the Monitor section, inspect interactions, summaries, and tags to understand what the agent did and why, including tool calls and routing decisions.
</Step>

<Step title="Tighten instructions, skills, and tools">
  Adjust instructions, refine skills, and change tool parameters or availability. Re‑test and repeat until you’re comfortable with behavior.
</Step>

<Step title="Roll out gradually">
  Start with low‑risk traffic (for example a subset of callers or a beta chat entry point) and watch dashboards and issues closely before expanding.
</Step>
</Steps>

See: [`Monitor → Interactions`](/monitor/interactions), [`Monitor → Dashboard`](/monitor/dashboard), and [`Monitor → Issues`](/monitor/issues).

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I start with chat only?">
    Yes. Many teams start with chat (widget or embed) and add voice and other channels later; agents, skills, and tools are reused across channels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need my production telephony or CCaaS connected to get value?">
    No. You can start with a sandbox SIP trunk or a single test number, validate behavior, then wire Wonderful into production telephony or CCaaS once you are confident.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where do I see logs, issues, and performance?">
    Use the Monitor area for interactions, dashboards, governance, and issues; alerts and tagging make it easy to debug and track behavior over time.
  </Accordion>
