# Governance

Governance in Wonderful covers the guardrails, policies, and audit capabilities that ensure agents behave safely and compliantly across tenants, channels, and use cases.

## Overview

Governance capabilities include:

- **Configuration guardrails** at the agent and tool level (for example governance flags, PII, automated issues).  
- **Monitoring and alerts** on key metrics and behaviors.  
- **Audit logging** for sensitive actions and configuration changes.

Use this page to understand the governance surfaces exposed in Monitor and how they relate to configuration and runtime behavior.

<Info>
  Governance is not a single feature; it’s a **layered set of controls** spanning agent configuration, alerts, issues, privacy, and audit logging.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Agent-level governance settings**  
   - Agents expose flags such as:
     - `GovernanceEnabled`: whether governance capabilities are active.  
     - `AutomatedIssuesEnabled`: whether automated issue detection is enabled.  
     - PII configuration and related privacy settings.  
   - These settings influence how interactions are monitored and when issues are raised automatically.
2. **Alerts and metrics**  
   - Alerts (see `Alert` model) provide metric-based triggers on behaviors such as tool failures, forwarding, and interaction duration.  
   - Governance uses these signals to enforce thresholds and highlight non-compliant behavior.
3. **Issues and QA**  
   - Automated issues and QA ratings can flag interactions that violate policies or expectations, driving follow-up work in Issues.
4. **Audit logging**  
   - Audit logging tracks key configuration changes and sensitive operations (for example changes to agents, tools, integrations, retention, and PII settings) with resource types and change maps.  
   - This supports compliance and forensic analysis.

## Components

- **Governance flags and settings**  
  - Agent- and tenant-level toggles that enable or configure governance behaviors.

- **Alerts and metrics**  
  - Metric-based guardrails that surface undesirable behavior or performance issues.

- **Issues and automated issues**  
  - Work items created manually or automatically to track policy violations and problems.

- **Audit logs**  
  - Records of who changed what and when, for sensitive resources.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Define governance requirements">
  Clarify which policies and behaviors must be enforced (for example PII handling, maximum durations, acceptable tool failure rates).
</Step>

<Step title="Enable governance features on agents">
  Turn on governance and automated issues where appropriate, and configure PII and privacy settings to match your policies.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure alerts and thresholds">
  Create alerts on key governance metrics (duration, tool failures, forwarding, interaction volume) and tune thresholds to match your risk tolerance.
</Step>

<Step title="Use issues and audit logs to enforce policies">
  Use Issues to track and resolve violations, and rely on audit logs to review configuration changes when investigating incidents.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does enabling governance on an agent do?">
    Enabling governance activates governance-related behaviors such as automated issue creation and potentially stricter monitoring and tagging for that agent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do alerts relate to governance?">
    Alerts provide metric-based triggers that can surface policy violations or risk conditions, feeding into governance workflows and issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does audit logging fit into governance?">
    Audit logs record sensitive configuration changes and user actions, providing traceability and evidence for compliance and post-incident review.
