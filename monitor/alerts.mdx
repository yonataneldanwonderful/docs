# Alerts

Alerts notify you when agent behavior, interactions, or platform metrics cross thresholds you care about, so you can react before issues impact customers.

## Overview

Wonderful’s alerting system is built around:

- **Alert definitions** (`Alert` model) that specify metrics, conditions, and scope (agent, tool, tenant).  
- **Conditions and schedules** that control when an alert should fire.  
- **Actions and incidents** that route notifications and track alert history.

Use Alerts to monitor error rates, tool failures, call forwarding, and other key signals across tenants and agents.

<Info>
  Alerts are **tenant-scoped** and support both platform-wide and agent- or tool-specific conditions, with severity, reminders, and schedules.

## How It Works

1. **Alert definitions**  
   - Each `Alert` includes:
     - `Name`, `Description`.  
     - `Metric`: what to measure (for example `ActiveInteractions`, `Duration`, `ToolFailure`).  
     - `Estimator`: how to aggregate (average, minimum, maximum, 95th percentile, last value).  
     - `WindowValue` + `TimeUnit`: how far back in time to evaluate (for example last 15 minutes, 1 hour).  
     - `Interval`: how often to evaluate the condition.  
     - Optional `ToolName` and `AgentID` to scope the alert.
2. **Conditions and thresholds**  
   - `TriggerConditions` is a `ConditionNode` tree supporting logical operators (`And`, `Or`) and comparison operators (`GreaterThan`, `LessThan`, `EqualTo`, `NoData`) with a `value`.  
   - This lets you express simple or nested conditions over metrics.
3. **Severity and schedules**  
   - `Severity` indicates importance (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).  
   - `ActiveSchedule` (a list of weekday/time ranges) defines when the alert should be evaluated.  
   - `ReminderFrequencyMinutes` and `NotifyOnResolvedIncidents` control how often to remind and whether to notify on resolution.
4. **Actions and incidents**  
   - `AlertActions` define notification channels and behaviors.  
   - `AlertIncidents` track each time an alert condition is triggered, including open/closed state and timestamps.

## Components

- **Alert (definition)**  
  - Encodes metric, estimator, window, time unit, interval, scope, severity, schedule, and conditions.

- **Metrics**  
  - Built-in metrics like `ActiveInteractions`, `ToolFailure`, `Duration`, and forwarding-related metrics.

- **ConditionNode**  
  - Tree structure combining logical operators and comparison operators for thresholds.

- **AlertSchedule**  
  - Weekday and time range entries controlling when alerts are active.

- **AlertActions & AlertIncidents**  
  - Actions define where alerts go; incidents track each occurrence over time.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify key metrics">
  Decide which metrics matter most for your deployment (for example active interactions, tool failure rate, call forwarding percentage).
</Step>

<Step title="Create alert definitions">
  In the Alerts UI, create alerts with clear names, choose metrics and estimators, set window and interval, and scope them to specific agents or tools if needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Define conditions and severity">
  Configure trigger conditions (for example duration &gt; 600 seconds, tool failure &gt; 1%) and assign appropriate severity and schedules.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure actions and recipients">
  Set up AlertActions so the right teams receive notifications via their preferred channels.
</Step>

<Step title="Review incidents and tune">
  Use alert incidents and dashboards to see how alerts behave, then adjust thresholds, windows, or severity to reduce noise and increase usefulness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What kinds of metrics can I alert on?">
    Alerts support metrics like active and total interactions, interaction duration, forwarding amount/percentage, and tool- and application-level failure metrics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I prevent noisy alerts?">
    Use appropriate window sizes, estimators (for example 95th percentile instead of max), and schedules, and tune thresholds based on real data before rolling out widely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I scope alerts to a single agent or tool?">
    Yes. Use <code>AgentID</code> and <code>ToolName</code> fields to scope alerts to specific agents or tools.
