# Issues

Issues represent trackable problems discovered in interactions, alerts, or evals, providing an operational workflow for triage, assignment, and resolution.

## Overview

Issues help teams:

- Capture and structure problems (for example agent misbehavior, tool failures, policy violations).  
- Link those problems to specific interactions and transcripts.  
- Assign ownership and track status until resolution.

They sit between raw signals (alerts, interactions, eval failures) and longer-term product or configuration changes.

<Info>
  Use Issues when something discovered in **Monitor** should lead to a concrete follow-up action, owner, and lifecycle — not just an ad-hoc fix.

## How It Works

1. **Issue records**  
   - The `Issue` model includes:
     - `TenantId`, `Identifier` (for example `ISS-123`).  
     - `CommunicationId`, `TranscriptId` linking to a specific interaction and transcript.  
     - `Status` (`open`, `in-progress`, `resolved`, `closed`).  
     - `Severity`, `Category`, `RootCause`, `Description`.  
     - `IsSystemCreated` (for issues automatically generated by the system) and `Private` flags.
2. **Assignees and comments**  
   - `IssueAssignee` associates issues with users responsible for resolution.  
   - `IssueComment` tracks comments and status changes, with types (`comment`, `activity`) and from/to status transitions.
3. **Creation paths**  
   - Issues can be:
     - Created manually from the Interactions view.  
     - Created automatically by governance or QA systems (for example automated issues).  
     - Linked from alerts or eval runs.
4. **Lifecycle and history**  
   - Status and severity changes, assignee updates, and comments form the activity history used for auditing and review.

## Components

- **Issue list**  
  - Filterable table showing identifier, status, severity, category, assignees, and linked interactions.

- **Issue detail view**  
  - Shows description, root cause, comments, activity, and links to interactions, alerts, or evals.

- **Filters and views**  
  - Filter by status, severity, category, assignee, tenant, agent, and creation time.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Create issues from signals">
  When alerts, interactions, or evals reveal a recurring or serious problem, create an issue capturing context, severity, and category.
</Step>

<Step title="Assign owners and set status">
  Use assignees and status fields to make it clear who is responsible and whether the issue is open, in progress, resolved, or closed.
</Step>

<Step title="Investigate linked interactions">
  Follow links to communications and transcripts to understand root causes and confirm fixes.
</Step>

<Step title="Close the loop">
  Once resolved, document the root cause and fix in comments, update status, and ensure any necessary Build, governance, or configuration changes are tracked elsewhere.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What’s the difference between an alert and an issue?">
    Alerts are signals generated from metrics crossing thresholds; issues are tracked work items with owners and lifecycles created in response to those signals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can issues be created automatically?">
    Yes. System-created issues (<code>IsSystemCreated = true</code>) can be generated by governance or QA logic based on defined rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How should I use severity and category?">
    Use severity to indicate urgency and impact, and category to group similar problems (for example tooling, content, routing, compliance) for later analysis.
