# Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard gives you a real-time and historical view of how agents, interactions, and tools are performing across tenants.

## Overview

The dashboard is designed for:

- **Operations and support teams** monitoring live traffic and health.  
- **Product and CX teams** tracking trends in behavior, sentiment, and outcomes.  
- **Engineering and platform teams** watching tool failures, latency, and alerts.

It pulls from interaction records (`Communication`), alerts, issues, and evals to give a consolidated picture of system health.

<Info>
  Use the dashboard to answer “How are we doing **right now**?” and “Where did things go wrong **recently**?” before diving into detailed interaction or issue views.

## How It Works

1. **Data sources**  
   - The dashboard aggregates:
     - Interaction statistics (`CommunicationStatistics`) including duration, status, sentiment, tokens, QA score, and tags.  
     - Alert and incident data for active and recent alerts.  
     - Issue counts and statuses for operational follow-up.
2. **Aggregation and refresh**  
   - Data is aggregated by tenant, agent, channel, and time window.  
   - Dashboards are refreshed periodically and can be filtered to focus on recent activity or specific segments.
3. **Drill-down flows**  
   - From high-level KPIs you can drill into:
     - Interactions for a given segment (for example a specific agent, channel, tag).  
     - Issues created from alerts or QA workflows.  
     - Evals linked to recent configuration changes.

## Components

- **KPI tiles**  
  - High-level metrics such as total interactions, active interactions, average duration, QA score, sentiment distribution, and forwarding rate.

- **Filters**  
  - Filters by tenant, agent, channel, timeframe, status, sentiment, tags, and more.

- **Charts and time-series views**  
  - Trends over time for key metrics like volume, duration, failures, and alerts.

- **Drill-down links**  
  - Links into Interactions, Issues, and Alerts views for deeper investigation.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Set your default view">
  Choose filters (tenant, channel, agents, timeframe) that reflect your core use case and save or reuse them as your starting point.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor live KPIs">
  During operations, watch active interactions, error rates, and alert counts to spot incidents early.
</Step>

<Step title="Investigate anomalies">
  When you see unusual spikes or drops, drill into Interactions and Issues to understand root causes.
</Step>

<Step title="Review historical performance">
  Use longer time windows to assess trends in QA scores, sentiment, durations, and tool failures, and feed that back into Build and governance changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where does the dashboard data come from?">
    Dashboard metrics are derived from interaction records (<code>Communication</code> and <code>CommunicationStatistics</code>), alerts, and issues, aggregated by tenant and agent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often is the dashboard updated?">
    Dashboards are refreshed periodically based on recent data; exact refresh intervals depend on deployment configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize dashboard views per team?">
    Yes. Teams can use filters, saved views (where supported), and drill-downs to create views aligned with their responsibilities.
