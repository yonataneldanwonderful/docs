# Interactions

The Interactions view lets you inspect individual conversations across channels, including transcripts, tags, metrics, recordings, and QA annotations.

## Overview

Each interaction is backed by a `Communication` record that captures:

- Channel and direction (voice, chat, email; inbound or outbound).  
- Timing and duration.  
- Sentiment, QA scores, and ratings.  
- Tags, call tags, and metadata.  
- Links to recordings and summaries.

Use this page when you need to review specific conversations, perform QA, or debug unexpected behavior.

<Info>
  Interactions are the **source of truth** for what actually happened in conversations — including transcripts, tool usage, tags, and outcomes.

## How It Works

1. **Interaction records**  
   - `Communication` and `CommunicationDTO` store:
     - `Type`, `Interactor`, `Direction`, `AgentId`, `Locale`, `Status`.  
     - `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `Duration`.  
     - `TokensUsage`, `QAScore`, `Summary`.  
     - `Tags`, `CallTags`, `Metadata`, `HumanFeedback`, and bookmark state.  
     - Recording keys/URLs (raw, processed, masked).
2. **Transcripts and recordings**  
   - Transcripts and recordings are associated through `CommunicationDTO` and related transcript models, exposing:
     - Turn-by-turn text.  
     - Speaker information (agent, human).  
     - Masked and unmasked audio where permitted.
3. **Tags and call tags**  
   - Tags originate from deterministic rules and LLM tagging pipelines; call tags capture call-specific categorizations.  
   - Both are available in Interactions for filtering and analysis.
4. **Metrics and summaries**  
   - Metrics like duration, QA scores, ratings, and tokens usage are computed per interaction.  
   - Summaries provide brief and detailed descriptions with bullet points.

## Components

- **Interaction list**  
  - Filterable table of interactions with key columns (agent, channel, duration, sentiment, QA score, tags, status).

- **Interaction detail view**  
  - Transcript, recordings, summary, tools usage, tags, metadata, and ratings for a single interaction.

- **Filters and search**  
  - Filters by agent, channel, sentiment, tags, QA score, status, timeframe, and other metadata.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter to the right slice">
  Use filters (agent, channel, tags, timeframe, sentiment) to narrow down interactions relevant to your investigation or QA review.
</Step>

<Step title="Open interaction details">
  Inspect transcripts, recordings, summaries, and tags to understand what happened in each conversation.
</Step>

<Step title="Annotate and link to issues">
  Where needed, create issues from interactions or add human feedback and ratings to feed back into QA and evals.
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor patterns">
  Regularly review interactions with specific tags or failure states to find systematic problems and opportunities to improve agents.
</Step>

## FAQ's

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What data is stored for each interaction?">
    Interactions store channel, direction, timing, sentiment, QA scores, tokens usage, tags, call tags, metadata, transcripts, recordings (including masked variants), and summaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do tags and call tags differ?">
    Tags capture general categorizations (topics, intents, outcomes), while call tags capture call-specific or rule-based labels used in routing, QA, or compliance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export interactions for offline analysis?">
    Yes, subject to retention and PII policies; consult your deployment’s export capabilities and privacy configuration.
